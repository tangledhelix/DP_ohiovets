<p>On the twentieth anniversary of the organization of
the Twenty-ninth regiment Ohio Veteran volunteer infantry,
Comrade J. H. SeCheverell was instructed to prepare
a history of the same, and the undersigned were
appointed a committee to supervise its publication.
Comrade SeCheverell, after months of perplexing labor,
completed the manuscript which was examined by us in
Cleveland, July 19, 1882. It was then decided to issue
fifty proof copies of the work to be put into the hands
of members of the regiment for such additions or corrections
as should be found necessary. This was done, and
after the return of the proofs and the incorporation of
whatever corrections they contained, Comrade SeCheverell
visited Akron, and spent several days with Colonel
Schoonover, to whom was intrusted the corrections
for that vicinity, and it is with no small degree of satisfaction
that we now present the work to the comrades
and friends of the regiment with our hearty endorsement,
believing it <em>as complete and perfect as it is possible
to make it</em>.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="AUTHORS_PREFACE">AUTHOR'S PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p>In the following pages no attempt at literary gush is
made, the design being simply to preserve from oblivion
the record of the valiant deeds of this, the bravest of the
brave regiments from the Buckeye State, that in the dim,
distant future, when each comrade shall have answered
to his last earthly roll-call and gone to the "grand
review" with the many whose bones now repose in that
far away country of the orange and the magnolia, those
left behind may not forget the sacrifices made, and the
untold dangers endured for that flag, the beautiful, starry
emblem of a now united people, whose supremacy preserved
for them the blessings of this great country, the
best beneath the ethereal vault of heaven.</p>

<p>The data from which the journal portion of the volume
is composed was obtained from members of the regiment,
who certify to its correctness. Colonel Jonas
Schoonover furnished, from Atlanta to Washington.</p>

<p>The reader will mark the entire absence of personal
laudation so common in works of this class, and the
crowding of a few favored ones to the front to the exclusion
of the hundreds of equally brave and meritorious
men in perhaps lowly positions. That the fortunes of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
war brought many forward with flattering prominence is
most true, and that thousands who wore the simple
blouse of blue and carried the musket were possessed of
merit as great is also true. To have been a member of
the Twenty-ninth Regiment Ohio Veteran Volunteers is
glory enough for a lifetime. If you did your duty, it is
well; if you failed, printers' ink will not make a hero of
you. Then let each be content with the happy assurance
that he did what he could for the flag.</p>

<p>The writer would acknowledge in an especial manner
his obligations to L. D. Drum, adjutant-general of the
United States army, for the very complete casualty list at
the close of the volume; also, to Samuel B. Smith, adjutant-general
of Ohio, Hon. E. B. Taylor, Colonel
Edward Hayes, Jonas Schoonover, Captain R. H. Baldwin,
George W. Holloway; the members of the very
efficient revisory committee, Captains D. W. Thomas, T.
W. Nash, Lieutenant T. E. Hoyt, Sergeant E. F. Mason,
and C. H. Coon; the Ashtabula Sentinel, Jefferson
Gazette, and the Akron Daily News, for numerous
courtesies extended to him, during the preparation of
this work; and to each comrade and friend who has aided
him in his labors, to name all of whom would require
many pages. He has conscientiously endeavored to
make the volume free from errors. If he has succeeded
it will be the first of its kind. However, such as it is, it
is presented to the regiment and its friends with the
belief that it contains much of value.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</h2>
</div>

<p>The author of this volume has honored me with an
invitation to write an "Introduction." A book without
a preface would be an anomaly: in other words, out of
harmony with established usage; not strictly important,
but answering much the same purpose as the "whereas"
preceding the resolutions of the convention.</p>

<p>I have not been permitted to read the author's manuscript,
yet I do not hesitate to assure the reader that as
he peruses the pages of the book he will find much to
entertain and profit. To the veteran who enlisted and
fought in the historic "Twenty-ninth Ohio Veteran
volunteer infantry" it will be read with especial interest.
The eye will moisten, and the heart swell with mingled
emotions as he is reminded again of the varying scenes
of the camp, the march, and the battle. Others, too
young to remember anything of the war, but who have
heard the stories of the conflict from their fathers, will
read this historic sketch of the old regiment with the
greatest avidity.</p>

<p>We well remember the author as "Hamp," the drummer
boy of Company B, his boyish look, with his neatly-fitting
suit of blue, and the tenor drum suspended from
his neck, while with nimble fingers he plied the ebony
sticks in beating the tattoo, reveille, or the "long roll."</p>

<p>He has done a real and invaluable service to his comrades
in gathering up and condensing in neat and durable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
form so many interesting facts relating to the work of a
noble regiment. So much, at least, is saved from
oblivion.</p>

<p>In writing the history of any war only a mere outline
can be thought of. Anything like a full and detailed
account of what happened is out of the question.
Neither time nor space would permit.</p>

<p>The multiplied thousands who carried their muskets
and knapsacks on foot all over "Dixie," and who really
did the hard work of the conflict, must be massed in
history even as in war they were massed against the foe.
Their individual deeds of daring and suffering were not
a whit behind those of the great Wellingtons, Washingtons,
and Grants. The latter were in positions to glide
easily into history, and have their heroic deeds emblazoned
and read in the books of every nation. The
former may have loved their country as well and fought
as bravely for her honor, and yet die in obscurity, "to
fortune and to fame unknown."</p>

<p>Dr. SeCheverell has doubtless done his best under the
circumstances to do justice to the name of every member
of the old Twenty-ninth. It was known as the Giddings'
regiment, in honor of the Hon. Joshua R. Giddings, for
twenty consecutive years a member of the lower house
of Congress.</p>

<p>Perhaps no man during his time did more than Mr.
Giddings to create public opinion in favor of the freedom
of the slave. The regiment was raised almost entirely
within the bounds of his old district, and it was fitting
that it should bear his name. But I remember that
when recruiting it a frequent objection to enlistment was
that should any member of the regiment be so unfortunate
as to be taken prisoner by the "Rebs," he would
be forthwith shot, hung, or burnt at the stake, particularly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
on Giddings' account, and that the name would be
so odious in the South, and would so advertise the regiment
that every member would be especially hunted
down and exterminated.</p>

<p>I think "Hamp" has failed utterly to ascertain that
any prisoner from the Twenty-ninth was thus punished,
although many of the boys were often in rebel hands.</p>

<p>I have ever considered myself fortunate and honored
in having been associated with such a regiment.</p>

<p>I was duly appointed and commissioned as the first
chaplain, holding the position one year, resigning at the
expiration of that time, and receiving an honorable discharge
from the service.</p>

<p>Of the officers of the regiment much might be said.
Nobody who ever knew Colonel Buckley will ever forget
him. A brave man, a great admirer of order and discipline,
faultlessly neat and tidy, a confirmed dyspeptic;
yet the most ticklish and fun provoking humor often
cropped out in his conversation and intercourse with
men. One morning, away down between Bull Run and
Fredericksburg, when the tired and jaded men were in
line for the day's march, the Colonel was in his saddle
with his toes daintily touching the stirrups, his pale, clean
shaven face shaded by the visor of his blue cap, from
beneath which his practiced eye swept the whole regiment
at a glance, while his well-polished sword, firmly
gripped, stood perpendicular, resting against the shoulder;
with a stentorian voice he published the following
order: "Men of the Twenty-ninth, let there be no
straggling on the march to-day. But if any of you do
straggle take Twenty-ninth off from your caps and put
on One Hundred and Tenth Pennsylvania."</p>

<p>The joke on the One Hundred and Tenth Pennsylvania
was fully appreciated and immensely enjoyed (a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
regiment noted for straggling). With roars of laughter
the boys shouldered their muskets and knapsacks for
another hard day's march through the pine barrens.</p>

<p>Lieutenant-colonel Clark is remembered as a staunch
advocate of temperance, whose interests were ever for
the men.</p>

<p>Major Clemmer, as a genial, bluff soldier, whose songs
often enlivened the dreariness of the camp or bivouac;
and Quartermaster Gibbs, as a man of prompt execution,
who expected equal promptness from others. Many
anecdotes and incidents of them could be narrated
by the page, but I remember that the introduction
to the volume is not the place for sketches of this kind;
and I fear that I have already introduced much that does
not strictly belong to this part of the book. I beg pardon
for any seeming trespass in this direction.</p>

<p>This introduction, written in the midst of other pressing
duties, with frequent interruptions, now most affectionately
inscribes this volume to every member of the
Twenty-ninth regiment of Ohio Veteran volunteer infantry;
to their wives and their children.</p>

<p>I am happy to enjoy this privilege of saying a few
words in Dr. SeCheverell's book to my old comrades.
My prayer is that God will bless every surviving member
of the regiment, with their families, also the widows and
orphans of deceased members, and that when the battle
of life is over, we may wear the victor's crown in heaven.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center"><small>The South Preparing for War&mdash;The Fall of Sumter&mdash;The Grand
Rally to the Support of the Flag&mdash;Formation of the Regiment.</small></p>

<p>President Lincoln, in his inaugural address of March
4, 1861, said: "I have no purpose, directly or indirectly,
to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States
where it exists. I believe that I have no lawful right,
and I have no inclination to do so." The South had
apparently decided otherwise, and continued the preparations
for secession, begun under the administration
of, and so ably seconded by that old imbecile, James Buchanan.</p>

<p>The outlook became so fraught with danger to the
Union, that on April 7th a naval expedition sailed from
New York to the relief of Fort Sumter. Its arrival off
Charleston harbor was followed by a furious bombardment
of the fort by the rebel batteries of General Beauregard.
The capitulation on April 13th, of the little
handful of gallant men who so bravely defended their
country's flag, was followed by an outburst of patriotic
indignation perhaps never before witnessed in the history
of the world. In an incredibly short space of
time the President's call for seventy-five thousand men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
was filled by citizens eagerly marching to the defense
of the National capital.</p>

<p>The rebels meanwhile were busily engaged in appropriating
or destroying the available arms and munitions
of war belonging to the Government. At Bull Run, a
few miles from Washington, General Beauregard massed
his rebel horde, and here, on July 21st, General McDowell
gratified the insane "On to Richmond" cry, by giving
them battle. The result was the complete overthrow of
the Union army, which retreated in the wildest disorder
to Washington. This event cast a deep gloom over
the entire North (barring the copperhead element).
More than twice the time allowed by the knowing(?)
ones to crush the Rebellion (sixty days) had elapsed,
and yet it was growing stronger every day. The North
was not yet awake to the magnitude of the work it had
undertaken. The first patriotic outburst was on the
wane; the sympathy of England and the encouragement
given to the rebels by the "copperheads" in the North,
gave a prestige to the Southern cause which, to many,
bespoke the final success of treason. In this dark hour
of our country's peril, that brave old hero, Joshua R.
Giddings, with B. F. Wade, E. B. Woodbury, and other
well known associates, feeling that they had been disappointed
in the acts of another regiment, made up in
part of soldiers recruited in this district, obtained permission
to organize regiment number Twenty-nine, which
should be made up as far as possible, of those in political
sympathy with the projectors. The report of the
soldiers already returned from the three months' service,
and who were generally ready to go again, seemed to indicate
who they wished for commanders. Major Lewis
P. Buckley, of Akron, educated at West Point, was generally
desired as colonel, and Thomas Clark, of Cleveland,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
formerly a cadet at Norwich university, Vermont,
was for the same reason selected to commence the work.
He was accordingly appointed major, on the 13th of
August. Two days later he was mustered into service,
and ordered to report at once to Jefferson, select a suitable
location, and organize a camp. On the 17th he
arrived at Jefferson, and a couple of days were spent in
examining fields offered; at last the grounds of the
County Agricultural Society were selected. A part of
company A reported on the 19th, and company B in the
afternoon of the same day. The camp equipage arrived
on the 20th. On the 27th company C reported, and on
September 10th, company D, and with this company
came Colonel Buckley, who had just completed his service
in the Nineteenth regiment.</p>

<p>Following are the companies, in the order they entered
the service, with the commanders and the localities
from which they were recruited: Company A, Captain
William F. Fitch, was recruited in Jefferson and vicinity,
and Hartsgrove. Company B, Captain Wilbur F. Stevens,
was recruited in Pierpont and vicinity, and Harpersfield.
Company C, Captain Edward Hayes, was
recruited in Andover and vicinity, Gustavus, Ohio, and
Espyville, Pennsylvania. Company D, Captain Pulaski
C. Hard, was recruited in Akron, Summit county. Company
E, Captain Horatio Luce, was recruited in Conneaut
and surrounding townships. Company F, Captain
John F. Morse, was recruited in Painesville and Mentor,
Lake county, and Montville, Geauga county. Company
G, Captain John S. Clemmer, was recruited in Akron
and vicinity. (Second Lieutenant W. P. Williamson, of
this company, who was shot dead at the battle of Winchester,
Virginia, March 23, 1862, was the first man in
the regiment to die by rebel hands.) Company H, Captain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
Jonas Schoonover, was recruited in Akron and vicinity.
Company I, Captain Russell B. Smith, was
recruited in Medina county, and by transfers, and company
K, Captain Alden P. Steele, was recruited from
the various townships in Ashtabula county.</p>

<p>The adverse causes before referred to, materially retarded
the enlistment of the regiment, and it was not
until about December 1st that the different company
organizations were completed and the following staff
officers elected:</p>

<p>Colonel Lewis P. Buckley, Akron, Summit county.</p>

<p>Lieutenant-colonel Thomas Clark, Cleveland, Cuyahoga
county.</p>

<p>Major John S. Clemmer, Mogadore, Summit county.</p>

<p>Adjutant C. T. Chaffee, Jefferson, Ashtabula county.</p>

<p>Quartermaster O. F. Gibbs, Harpersfield, Ashtabula
county.</p>

<p>Chaplain R. H. Hurlburt, Hartsgrove, Ashtabula
county.</p>

<p>Surgeon A. K. Fifield, M.D., Conneaut, Ashtabula
county.</p>

<p>Assistant Surgeon S. S. Burrows, M.D., Geneva,
Ashtabula county.</p>

<p>Commissary Henry Wright, Trumbull, Ashtabula
county.</p>

<p>Sergeant-major W. P. Williamson, Akron, Summit
county.</p>

<p>Quartermaster-sergeant M. D. Norris, Mesopotamia,
Trumbull county.</p>

<p>Hospital Steward E. P. Haynes, Atwater, Portage
county.</p>

<p>Fife-major Richard Noonan, Hudson, Summit
county.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span></p>

county.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>During the interim came the easy days of soldier life.
Ah! those happy, golden days of camp life, when, with
guard mount, battalion drill, and dress parade, the time
passed swiftly away, and each heart beat high with patriotic
desire for early marching orders; days looked back
to from the dreary bivouac in the snow, tentless, and
with clothing in tatters, scarce covering the form from
the bitter, cutting winds of winter, or in the drizzling
rain on the lonely outpost when sharp-eyed rebels only
waited for the opportunity to send the leaden messenger
of death whizzing in your direction. Sometimes the
"boys" thought the rations were not sufficiently "gilt-edged,"
quite too plain in fact, for the savers of the
country's honor, yet how often, while trying, almost in
vain, with the half-pint of raw meal to keep the soul and
the poor emaciated body together in those hell devised
starvation traps&mdash;Libby, Belle Isle, Andersonville, and
Salisbury&mdash;did the brave fellows turn with longing hearts
to the bounteous commissary at old Camp Giddings.
Fears were oft expressed lest the war would close before
the Twenty-ninth should be permitted to add its mite to
the support of the flag. How needless they were the
rolls show; more than one-third (five hundred and forty)
of the one thousand five hundred and thirty-two members
of the regiment, were either killed, wounded, or
missing in action, and one hundred and fifty-seven died
of disease. The colors, too, which waved so grandly in
the sharp winter air, that long agone Christmas morning
in 1861, are now in shreds, rent and torn by the leaden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
hail through which they were carried to glorious victories.</p>

<p>This beautiful stand of colors was presented to the
regiment on Wednesday, November 27th, by Hon. J. R.
Giddings, on behalf of the donors, the ladies of Ashtabula
and Summit counties. Mr. Giddings spoke as follows:
"Gentlemen, officers and soldiers. Before entering
upon the particular duty assigned me on the present
occasion, I may be permitted to congratulate you
and the country, upon the completion of your regimental
organization and the perfection of your preparation
for the field. I desire you at all times to bear in
mind the causes which led to its formation. The present
rebellion has its origin far back in history. Its first
overt acts were put forth in Congress by subjecting the
people of the free States to gag rules, by striking down
the right of petition, by arraigning and publicly censuring
Representatives for the faithful discharge of duty, by
annexing, unconstitutionally, slave territory, and extending
and strengthening the encroachments of slavery. To
these violent encroachments upon the constitutional
rights of the free States, this Western Reserve has from
the first, presented a very general resistance....</p>

<p>"The ladies have prepared a splendid National and
regimental stand of colors, and have imposed on me the
pleasing duty of presenting them to the regiment. In
all past ages civilized nations have gone forth to war
under their own banner, on which was inscribed some
device, figure, or emblem, peculiar to such nation.
Thus each tribe among the Israelites had its particular
banner. The early Christians fought under the cross,
the Romans under the golden eagle, the Mohammedans
under the crescent. The founders of our government
selected for their colors a groundwork of blue, representing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
immutable justice and unlimited power, on which
the stars, representing light, are twinkling in the vaulted
heavens, while in mid ether the bird of Jove is floating,
a fitting representation of the ease and power with which
liberty and civilization are gliding over the earth; while
the stars and stripes of red and white represent the vital
principles and purity of our institutions.</p>

<p>[Addressing Colonel Buckley]: "To you, sir, as
commander, I present these beautiful standards, for the
use and benefit of the regiment. On behalf of the fair
donors I confide these National and regimental standards
to the care of yourself, your gallant officers and
men. Wherever you go let them be borne aloft and respected
as the emblem of universal freedom to all who
seek your protection. Preserve them unstained, except
by the blood of your enemies. Bear in mind that you
go forth to fight the battles of the human race for all
coming time; and should the roar of cannon, the rattling
of muskets, the clashing of sabres, the din and
smoke of battle surround you, remember the cause in
which you are engaged, and be assured that if you fall,
we who are left will care for your widows and children.
Your own heroic deeds shall be enshrined in our memories,
recorded in our history, admired by coming generations,
and approved by a holy and just God."</p>

<p>Colonel Buckley replied: "Respected Sir&mdash;I receive
this stand of colors in behalf of the Twenty-ninth
regiment. I return through you to the noble and
patriotic ladies of Ashtabula and Summit counties their
grateful thanks; and whenever and wherever it is unfurled
to the breeze, and we look upon its stars and
stripes, may we then remember the generous donors and
the vow we this day make. This flag, the flag of our
country, which has been our pride and our boast, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
which is respected by all civilized nations; this flag,
thank God, shall yet wave triumphantly wherever it has
been struck down by the ruthless arm of the traitors:
and, companions, whenever we look upon this beautiful
flag may it inspire us to redouble our energies to do our
duty to our beloved country, and if God in his providence
permits us to return to home and kindred, may
this flag come back with us to bear witness that the
Twenty-ninth regiment Ohio volunteers was in the
thickest of the fight.</p>

<p>"Sir, you have spoken in high commendation of my
command. I can assure you I feel myself honored in
having command of such a regiment. It will be my
pride and ambition, with my fellow-officers to make it in
all things pertaining to a well drilled and well disciplined
regiment, one of the best in Ohio. And now, fellow-soldiers,
in the presence of this assembly, and before
high heaven, we swear upon the altar of our country to
defend this flag so long as there shall be one true heart
and strong arm to hold it to the breeze."</p>

<p>At last the "boys'" impatience to go anywhere but
here, was gratified by an order to move to Camp Chase,
near Columbus, Ohio, the date December 25th; and
right here it may not be amiss to give an extract from
an editorial in the Ashtabula Sentinel, as showing what
the people of Jefferson thought of the regiment:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"They leave Jefferson with the respect and esteem of
our citizens as an orderly and well behaved body of men.
They have been over three months within our quiet village,
during which time no disturbance has occurred and
no depredations have been committed. They have
proved themselves honorable men, the best evidence that
they will be brave soldiers. When they are heard from
in the fight we have no fears of a bad account."</p>

<p class="center"><small>The Departure from Camp Giddings&mdash;At the Front&mdash;Death of Lander&mdash;Advance
up the Valley&mdash;Winchester.</small></p>

<p>Christmas morning, 1861, dawned clear, with the
earth bountifully covered with snow, and soon the busy
preparations for this the first march were apparent everywhere.
Knapsacks were packed, tents were struck, and
the camp equipage snugly put into shape for transportation
to Ashtabula, and at 10 o'clock the drums beat off. Then
the regiment filed out of the enclosure, bidding a
fond good-bye, many for the last time, to the old camp,
up through the town, where everybody was waiting to
wish the "boys" God speed. "Head of column left,"
and the Twenty-ninth regiment was en-route for Ashtabula
and the front, followed by the prayers of fathers,
mothers, brothers, sisters, and sweethearts, that its every
effort might be crowned with success, and that, if heaven
so willed, all might return safely to the arms of loved
ones, "when the cruel war was over." How beautiful
they looked in their new uniform, and how gaily the
bayonets glistened in the bright sunlight as each man
kept step to the music.</p>

<p>Arriving at Ashtabula, the regiment took cars, and
was soon whirling rapidly towards Columbus, where it
arrived the following day.</p>

<p>On disembarking from the cars, a march of four miles
on the National pike to the west brought the regiment to
Camp Chase, where it was assigned to barracks, and the
sweets (?) of soldier life began to be more perceptible.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
While lying here, the regiment attended the inauguration
of David Tod as Governor of Ohio, and perfected itself
in the school of the soldier. On the 26th day of January,
1862, the long roll again sounded; the Twenty-ninth
regiment fell in, and marched to the depot, a distance
of four miles. It took cars, and steamed away for
Dixie, passing through Newark and Zanesville, and
across the Ohio river at Bellair, thence via the Baltimore
&amp; Ohio railroad through the mountains of West Virginia
to a point some six miles below Cumberland, Maryland,
where it made its first camp in Dixie. There it was assigned
to the left flank of the Third brigade (the Seventh
Ohio volunteer infantry occupying the right), Colonel E.
B. Tyler commanding, and here it may be well to state
that from this time until the Seventh regiment was discharged
the service (July 8, 1864), the two regiments
occupied the same position, engaged in the same battles,
and endured an equal amount of the hard service incident
to the several campaigns. The Twenty-ninth remained
in active service for nearly a year after the
discharge of its well-bred friends of the Seventh and
until the collapse of the Rebellion. This for the benefit
of those who imagine that only one regiment was recruited
in Northern Ohio.</p>

<p>On February 5, 1862, a general movement was ordered
to entrap the forces of Stonewall Jackson, then occupying
Romney. The Twenty-ninth and its brigade took
cars to French's store, and marched some twenty miles
to a point between Romney and Winchester to intercept
the retreat of the rebels. The attempt was futile, however,
as those whom the federals sought had flown ere
the designated point was reached. This march was a
terrible one, and told heavily on the men, many of whom
succumbed to disease incident to exposure to the intense<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
cold, the fording of streams whose icy waters were often
waist deep, and the general hardships, were sent to hospital
at Cumberland, and never returned to duty. Returning
the following day, the regiment bivouacked at a
point some eight miles from the Baltimore &amp; Ohio railroad,
known as Pine Levels or the Heights of Hampshire.
Here it remained some ten days exposed to the
intense cold, without tents, few blankets, on short rations,
and no cooking utensils. Rude brush enclosures were
constructed, which served the same purpose as Artemus
Ward's window sash, sort of "tangle the cold" or "keep
out the coarsest." It was by the greatest effort that the
men were kept from freezing. This sort of thing seemed
a pretty tough introduction to the "Sunny South," but
hardships of this kind became the normal experience of
the Twenty-ninth regiment, and the sunny spots which
occasionally intervened were duly appreciated.</p>

<p>The next move was to the eastward to Paw Paw station
on the Baltimore &amp; Ohio railroad, near which the
Twenty-ninth and its brigade went into camp. February
22d, Washington's birthday, was duly observed. A
general review was indulged in. The streets were prettily
trimmed with evergreens; and arches, and other
pretty devices were numerous. The Twenty-ninth were
domiciled in small and nearly worn out wall tents.</p>

<p>On Saturday, March 1st, as the shades of evening
were falling, the Twenty-ninth and its command marched
with two days' rations, in the direction of Winchester,
Virginia, the object being the capture of that important
point. After an all night's march the command halted,
and, in a blinding snow storm, waited for further orders.
At 5 o'clock <span class="allsmcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span> a counter-march was ordered, and at
about midnight the old camp at Paw Paw was reached.
The object of this move was to attend the remains of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
brave General Lander to the cars, which was accomplished
on the following day. All the troops in the vicinity
were present. At 9 o'clock on the morning of Saturday,
March 8th, the command struck tents and
marched to the railroad; at night took cars and moved
in the direction of Martinsburg, en route for Winchester.
Some two or three days were occupied in reaching
the former place, as extreme caution was necessary. A
burned bridge at Back creek stopped further steam locomotion,
and on the 11th the command moved forward
through Martinsburg, encamping some two miles out on
the Winchester road. Here General James Shields, of
some celebrity in the Mexican war, assumed command
of the division, and the One Hundred and Tenth Pennsylvania
infantry volunteers was added to the brigade.
The following morning the column continued the forward
movement, under orders to join General Banks, in
his attack on Winchester. The rebels retreated, and
Shields' division went into camp to the north of Winchester,
some four miles out on the Martinsburg pike.</p>

<p>When the rebels first occupied Virginia General Johnston
(commanding the extreme left of Beauregard's army)
took possession of Winchester. Troops from here destroyed
the Baltimore &amp; Ohio railroad and constantly
harrassed our forces in the direction of Harper's Ferry
and Cumberland. It was of great importance that the
Union arms gain and hold possession of this point,
hence the concentration of Federal troops in this
vicinity.</p>

<p>Skirmishing with the enemy was a daily occurrence,
and, on the morning of March 20th, a reconnoissance in
force was made up the valley to Strasburg. General
Shields, with the Twenty-ninth and its brigade, numbering
some six thousand men, moved direct to that point,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
while Colonel Mason's brigade advanced on the Front
Royal road. At Cedar creek a lively artillery duel
transpired, during which the rebels succeeded in burning
the bridge. The following morning the entire command
fell back to its camp below Winchester. This was a march
which tested the men's power of endurance to its utmost.
The rain fell lightly but continuously during the
day. For rations the men had barely one cracker each,
and yet they made the entire distance&mdash;twenty-two
miles&mdash;in seven hours, halting only a few minutes about
noon.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center"><small>The Battle of Winchester or Kernstown&mdash;Stonewall Jackson Whipped.</small></p>

<p>At Kernstown, some four miles south of Winchester,
Jackson's command, numbering fully fifteen thousand
men, was massed, and on March 22d attacked the Union
outposts. The citizens of Winchester, who, by the way,
were about as thoroughly imbued with treason as at any
point within the writer's knowledge in the whole of the
chivalrous (?) South, were in high glee at the prospect of
being rid of those odious Lincoln hirelings, and some
were so sanguine of success to the Southern arms that
they prepared elegant repasts for the victors. However
that may be, the rebel horde did not enter Winchester
at this time, except, perhaps, a few dead ones carried
there for burial.</p>

<p>Soon after the firing began the First and Second
brigades of General Shields' division were moved to the
front, and a lively skirmish ensued resulting in the repulse
of the enemy. General Shields was wounded
quite severely during this brief engagement, and at night,
when active hostilities ceased, he retired to Winchester.
The dawn of Sunday, March 23d, was heralded by the
rapid boom of artillery and the lively rattle of musketry,
as the advance of the two armies resumed the skirmishing
of the previous afternoon. This was continued during
nearly the entire forenoon. About noon the long
roll beat throughout our camp; quickly the men fell into
line, and in columns of fours, under command of brave
Colonel Buckley, marched rapidly, a portion of the distance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
at a double quick, toward the point of attack.
On reaching Winchester the regiment halted, came to a
front, loaded their pieces, and remained until the artillery
and trains had passed. We then moved on the road
leading to Kernstown, some two or three miles, and
again halted. After some vexatious delay the regiment
again resumed the march and soon reached the scene of
the action, which was about seven miles from Winchester.
The enemy were under General Thomas J. Jackson
(Stonewall). His right extending across the Pike leading
to Strasburg, and his forces on his left masked behind
a stone fence, while at the rear for a considerable distance
the ground was a gradual ascent covered with stumps
and wood which were well used as cover. The Twenty-ninth
regiment and its brigade was moved to the extreme
right of the line, and, formed in close column, by
division, moved forward through the timber to the attack.
At close range the rebels opened a heavy fire, but
we continued to advance, halting at a small ravine where
we deployed in line of battle, and in this position a sharp
and determined engagement ensued. The distance
between the opposing forces did not exceed sixteen
rods. Late in the afternoon an order was given the
Third brigade to charge the rebel line. Quick as thought
the whole line sprang forward, and with cheers sounding
above the roar of the conflict, in the teeth of a murderous
fire, swept down over the stone wall and at the bayonet's
point drove the enemy from their chosen position.
To the rear they fled until reaching their artillery, where
another stand was made and a rally attempted. The
Union lead poured into their ranks with such deadly effect
that they soon became panic-stricken, and in the
greatest disorder retreated in whatever direction best
offered an avenue of escape, and Stonewall Jackson, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
pride of the South and by many considered the bravest
general in the rebel army, was whipped, and that, too, by
a force much inferior in numbers, many of whom had
never faced death before.</p>

<p>To make the victory still more sure our forces followed
the disordered mass of fleeing rebels and captured many
prisoners, until darkness closed over all, when our brave
boys returned to rest upon their laurels upon the bloody
field of carnage, bury the dead and care for the wounded.
The result of this battle was a loss to the rebels of
the Shenandoah valley, at that time of great importance
to them, with casualties amounting to some five hundred
men killed, wounded, and left on the field, and three
hundred prisoners. The loss of the Twenty-ninth regiment
in this action was: Five killed, seven wounded,
two missing; aggregate fourteen. See casualties at the
close of the volume for names.</p>

<p class="center"><small>Pursuit of Jackson&mdash;The "Long" March&mdash;Fredericksburg to Front
Royal&mdash;March to Waynesboro.</small></p>

<p>At early dawn on the morning of March 24th the
Union army pushed forward in pursuit of the retreating
rebels. The Twenty-ninth deployed as skirmishes in
the advance. Many wounded Confederates were found
in private houses along the line of march. About noon
the dashing rebel cavalry officer Ashby came from cover
and suddenly swooped down upon the regiment with
a heavy cavalry force. Rallying by companies and
forming squares, a well directed volley soon sent
the rebels in haste to the rear. The pursuit of
the fleeing rebels was continued until nightfall, when
the regiment went into bivouac near Cedar creek. The
next morning (25th) our columns again pushed forward
until reaching a point a little in advance of Strasburg,
where a halt was ordered and a camp (Kimball), established.
Here we remained for some time, making frequent
raids into the surrounding country and skirmishing
almost daily with the enemy.</p>

<p>April 1st the regiment again moved after the retreating
army, and about daylight on the following morning
indulged in some artillery firing with the rebel rear
guards. During the month of April the regiment
marched up the valley as far as Newmarket, passing the
towns of Woodstock and Mount Jackson. At the latter
place a hospital was established, and companies G and
E were detailed for provost, and other duties, in and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
around Mount Jackson, while the remainder of the regiment
moved up the valley to Camp Thurburn and continued
the usual picket, camp, and guard duties.</p>

<p>May 3d left camp and marched up the valley in the
direction of Harrisburg; halted about three miles from
town and camped for the night. May 5th, returned
from near the town of Harrisburg and went into camp
four miles above Newmarket, where the regiment remained
until the 12th day of May, when it left the
Shenandoah valley at Newmarket on the long march to
Fredericksburg, marched to Luray, and encamped for
the night (marched eighteen miles). Thirteenth, moved
at 7 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span> The Twenty-ninth, was detailed as rear guard.
Fourteenth, marched at 6, reached Front Royal at 3:30
<span class="allsmcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span> and camped for the night. Fifteenth, marched at 9 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span>,
traveled thirteen miles, and went into camp. Sixteenth,
marched at 6:30 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span>, reached Gains' Cross
Road, and camped for the night, (marched ten miles).
May 17th, marched at 6 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span>, and reached Warrenton
(distance of eighteen miles), and went into camp for the
night. Sunday, May 18th, remained in camp. Monday,
19th, marched at 5 o'clock <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span>, and at 3 <span class="allsmcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span>
reached the Orange &amp; Alexandria railroad at Catlet's
Station, and went into camp. Remained until May 21st,
when the regiment again marched at 6 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span>, halting at
10:30 <span class="allsmcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span> for the night. Twenty-second, marched at
7 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span>, reached Falmouth in the evening, and went into
camp. Friday, May 23d, the army under Major-general
McDowell was reviewed by Abraham Lincoln, the President
of the United States, with satisfactory results.
Sunday, 25th, marched at 6 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span>, and at 4:30 went
into camp. Twenty-sixth, marched at 5 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span>, and
camped for the night at Catlet's Station. Twenty-seventh,
marched some four miles on the Manassas Gap<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
railroad, and went into camp. Twenty-eighth, marched
at 5 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span> past White Plains; after tramping fifteen miles
went into camp. Twenty-ninth, marched at 7 o'clock
<span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span> in the direction of Front Royal, reached Rectortown
at 4 o'clock <span class="allsmcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span>, and two hours later fell in, in
light marching order, and moved forward, leaving the
baggage until May 31st, when at 4 o'clock <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span> it
moved forward towards Front Royal, reaching Piedmont
at 9 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span>, and Markham at 4 <span class="allsmcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span>; moved to
within six miles of Front Royal, and camped for the
night. June 1st, marched to Front Royal, and at 4 <span class="allsmcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span>
moved forward some three miles on the Luray road,
and went into camp. June 2d, marched at 6 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span>,
marched thirteen miles, and went into camp. Third,
marched at 7 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span>, reached Luray at 12 <span class="allsmcap">M.</span>, passed
through the town on the Newmarket road, some two
miles and camped. Fourth, remained in camp all day.
Fifth, marched at 5 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span>, marched four miles, halted,
put up our tents, and prepared to be comfortable, when
at 3 o'clock <span class="allsmcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span> we were ordered to move. This was
occasioned by the close proximity of the rebel batteries
on the opposite side of the river. The regiment marched
about one mile and again halted for the night. Sixth,
ordered to march at 4 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span>, fell into line at 5, moved
two miles, halted, stacked arms, soon fell in and
marched about two miles farther, pitched our tents, and
at 6 <span class="allsmcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span> fell in and marched back to the place the regiment
left in the morning, where we arrived at 12 at
night, and went into camp. Saturday, 7th, the regiment
was up at 4 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span> and marched at 9 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span> (the baggage
was ordered to Luray and Front Royal; Sergeant C. H.
Edgerly and Private Willard Denison, of Company H,
were furloughed home for thirty days), marched up the
east bank of the Shenandoah river, a distance of fourteen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
miles, halted at 6 <span class="allsmcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span>, and went into camp.
Eighth, marched at 4 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span>, halted at 6:30 for breakfast,
and at 8:15 again moved forward; soon heard the artillery
firing at Cross Keys on the west side of the Shenandoah
river and mountain. The regiment moved on up the
river and about 5 o'clock <span class="allsmcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span> were in sight of the
rebels, whose ambulances and train were moving rapidly
in retreat in the direction of Port Republic from the
battle of Cross Keys. The Union forces were under
the command of Major-general John C. Fremont, and
the Confederate army commanded by Major-general
Thomas J. Jackson. The Union army took shelter in a
strip of woods at the base of the Blue Ridge Mountain,
near Port Republic, Virginia, and bivouacked for the
night.</p>

<p class="center"><small>Battle of Port Republic&mdash;The Twenty-ninth Suffer Great Loss.</small></p>

<p>On June 9th, in the dim light of early morning the
enemy began to move, and soon our artillery opened a
brisk fire on them. The Twenty-ninth regiment, under
command of Colonel Buckley, was ordered to fall in,
and at 6:45 o'clock marched out of the timber into the
open field, and moved forward a short distance, when
the men unslung knapsacks and other equipage and,
reduced to light marching order, advanced by the right
flank, and when near the rebel position came into line
on the double quick. While doing so we were obliged
to pass a board fence; and at this critical time the rebels
opened a heavy fire of musketry, but the regiment
moved steadily forward and took position in the open
field. The rebels in front of our right wing were behind
a strong post and rail fence.</p>

<p>From the base of the mountain to the Shenandoah
river was about one-half mile. The extreme left of our
line extended into the timber and near the base of the
mountain with the right flank extending to the river.
The Fifth, Sixty-sixth and Seventh Ohio regiments were
on our left, and the Seventh Virginia, Seventh, Thirteenth
and Fourteenth Indiana on our right. The Twenty-ninth
being about the right center regiment during the
battle, and at this time in support of Huntington's battery,
which was belching forth its shot and shell, doing
deadly execution in the ranks of the advancing rebels.
When in close range the rebels charged. Reserving our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
fire until they were almost upon us, the order was given,
and with a yell the entire line poured its leaden hail
into the gray clad columns of the chivalry, producing
fearful slaughter, and following with a charge so impetuous
that they were forced to retire from their secure position
behind the fence, and here, for more than three
hours and a half, our brave fellows, though outnumbered
ten to one by the enemy and fighting against fate, kept
them at bay and held the position. During this charge
it is said that Allen Mason, of company C, Twenty-ninth
regiment, captured the colors of the Seventh
Louisiana Tigers, and Lieutenant Gregory and a part of
company F made prisoners of twenty-five of the same
regiment. At last the little handful, who had so gallantly
contended against such fearful odds, were forced
to retire. The Twenty-ninth regiment moved to the rear,
perhaps an eighth of a mile, and came to a halt, holding
the rebel forces in check until the entire Union forces
had passed to the rear. In the meantime the rebels had
opened fire upon us with a battery at close range, which
did fearful execution in our rapidly decimating ranks.
When all our troops had passed, our regiment faced to
the right and moved obliquely into the timber; the rebels
in the meantime passed down the road and we were
nearly surrounded, and now, for a distance of nearly
two miles occurred a desperate struggle for freedom.
The men fought with the desperation born of despair.
Brave old Colonel Buckley (who before beginning the
day's business addressed the regiment, saying: "Aim
low, men, and at every shot let a traitor fall!") on
foot, his own and one other horse having been disabled
by a shot, rallied the men, and with sword in hand with
them succeeded in cutting their way through the cordon
of gray devils almost surrounding them, and escaped to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
the mountains near, where some one hundred men of the
different regiments of the Third brigade, with Colonel
Buckley at their head, bivouacked for the night. The
small remainder of the regiment, except those killed,
wounded or captured, succeeded in reaching the main
army. Captain Baldwin says that those who reached the
main army of the Twenty-ninth regiment numbered only
thirteen officers and men.</p>

<p>The night succeeding this eventful day of blood and
carnage was spent amid the gloom and darkness of the
forest. The men gathered about their brave commander
as if to shield him from the damps of night, their
thoughts turning meanwhile to the absent comrades,
many of whom, how many they knew not, were lying,
still and ghastly, upon the bloody field, a sacrifice to the
incompetency of the general commanding. The day
following, the little band began its weary march to the
rear, seeking shelter at night in some unused furnace
buildings. The next day they came in sight of the rear
guard of the retreating army, where they found the small
remnant of the Twenty-ninth, who had escaped death or
capture, and who, when they saw their beloved colonel
alive and well, fairly rent the very heavens above with
their glad shouts of welcome.</p>

<p>The number of the Union army engaged in this battle
was some twenty-five hundred, and could form but one
line of battle, while Stonewall Jackson's official report
shows his army to have numbered some <em>thirty-four thousand</em>.
The Twenty-ninth regiment lost heavily in this
battle. The aggregate was: Killed, 12; wounded, 33;
captured, 105; total, 150.</p>

<p>After the battle the Twenty-ninth regiment moved
down the valley to Luray, where the command encamped
for a few days' rest, then forward to Front Royal, and on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
to Alexandria, reaching that point on June 27th, encamping
on a rise of ground immediately adjacent to
the line of fortifications. The Third brigade was now
composed of the Seventh, Fifth, Sixty-sixth, and Twenty-ninth
Ohio regiments, in the order named. General
Shields having resigned by reason of McDowell's misrepresentations
in relation to the ill-advised battle of
Port Republic, General Sturgis, who has recently received
so much adverse criticism through the press of
the country, for his brutal and inhuman treatment of his
men, was placed temporarily in command. After lying
at this point for nearly one month orders were received
to move to the aid of General McClellan on the Peninsula,
and we embarked on transports, but the order
was countermanded and the Third brigade marched
back to its old camp.</p>

<p>July 25th we were ordered to join the force of General
Pope, then marching via Warrenton to the Rapidan
river. Proceeding by rail to the former point the brigade
was reorganized and attached to Banks' Second
corps, afterwards changed to the Twelfth army corps, as
the First brigade of General Augur's Second division.
After a few days of "masterly inactivity" we marched
in the direction of Luray. Debouching to the left on
the road leading southward toward the Rapidan, we soon
reached Little Washington and went into camp. While
here the troops were reviewed by Generals Pope and
Banks, who complimented our brigade very highly upon
its perfection in drill and discipline. General Tyler was
here ordered to Washington, and Brigadier-general John
W. Geary, late colonel of the Twenty-eighth Pennsylvania
infantry volunteers, was placed in command of our
brigade. His regiment and Knapp's battery were also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
assigned to the brigade. A forward movement in the
direction of Culpeper Court House, Virginia (on the
Rapidan), was begun on August 8th. Here the Confederates
were preparing defences, and at Cedar Mountain,
some seven miles to the southwest of our position,
they were strongly fortified.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">1862.</p>

<p class="center"><small>Cedar Mountain&mdash;Battle&mdash;Severe Loss of Life&mdash;Forward to Alexandria.</small></p>

<p>August 8th, the regiment moved at 2 o'clock, advanced
to Culpeper Court House, and went into camp; and
at 10:40, on the morning of August 9th, moved forward
in the direction of Cedar mountain. Halted a short
time, and the Twenty-eighth Pennsylvania regiment was
sent to the right on an eminence as signal guard. The
remainder of the brigade soon advanced, halting at
intervals, as the day was insufferably hot (several men
died this day of sunstroke). At last, passing through a
piece of timber, we approached the open field with a
rolling country in our front, and at 1:30, while making
preparations for dinner (near a fine spring of water),
skirmishing and artillery firing was heard on our right,
which continued at intervals until 3:45, when the rebels
appeared in heavy force, ready for battle, and the Union
lines were formed without delay. The Twenty-ninth
regiment (commanded by Captain W. F. Stevens, of
Company B,) was ordered to advance and take position
in rear of a battery which had been placed on a ridge.
Here the regiment took position, the right resting on
the road, and the left extending into the field, covered
from the enemy by the hill on which the battery
was placed. The Twenty-ninth, with other regiments of
the brigade, was about on the right of the left wing of
the line in open field, while the right wing extended
across the road, and into the timber. The regiment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
remained in this position, supporting the battery, and
receiving a heavy fire from the rebel artillery in our front.
Here several men were wounded.</p>

<p>At 5 o'clock <span class="allsmcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span>, we moved over the crest of the
hill, to a cornfield some distance in advance of our previous
position. During the advance to this new position
a terrific cannonade opened on us, dealing great destruction
to our ranks. Apparently every cannon of the
enemy was let loose against us, but we never faltered in
this march of death, despite the terrible missiles that
were tearing through our bleeding ranks. Comrades
were falling, and brothers dying. The mangled and
bleeding victims of the fury and violence of war were left
thick around us, making the ground sacred on which
they fell; but we wavered not. Reaching a low piece
of ground, we halted, and were ordered to lie down
and continue firing. We remained for one hour in the
open field, exposed to this furious storm of grape and
canister, shot and shell. Comrades gave up their lives
so gently that it was scarce possible to tell the living
from the dead. The fatal missile struck the victim,
leaving the lifeless clay in the same attitude which the
living body occupied. During the fatal period death
assumed a real character while life seemed but a dream.
The engagement had now become general. The brigade
of General Prince came up, and formed on the left of
our regiment. The Sixty-sixth, Fifth, and Seventh Ohio
regiments were formed on our right, in the order named.
(The Twenty-eighth Pennsylvania regiment was not with
us in this engagement.)</p>

<p>At a given signal the brigade arose and, with defiant
yells, rushed forward to the charge. Prince's brigade on
the left moved forward with us. A sheet of flame and
smoke burst forth from rebel batteries, musketry replied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
to musketry, bayonet clashed with bayonet, and cheers
rang out against cheers, as one side or the other gained
the advantage in this deadly conflict. Daring warmed
into rashness, and bravery into recklessness. Hurrah!
we force them back, their line is broken, a battery is
almost within our grasp; when in this moment of seeming
certain victory, fresh columns of rebel infantry rush
upon us on the double-quick, masked batteries open on
us at the same moment a most furious enfilading fire,
causing our brave boys to reel and stagger. An
order comes for us to retire, when three-fourths of our
regiment have been placed out of the fight&mdash;dead or
wounded. Slowly and sadly the remaining few obey the
order, keeping our faces to the foe until fresh troops
arrive to take our places, when we resume our position
in the reserve near Telegraph hill. Each regiment of
the brigade had done nobly, but all alike had suffered
a loss so great that the four regiments together could
not show a respectable facing front for one regiment.
As night settled over the field of carnage and of death
our entire army corps withdrew to the position it held
early in the day, but our artillery kept up a desultory
firing, with but short intervals during the night.</p>

<p>The casualties of this battle were: Killed, 11;
wounded, 26; missing, 12. Total, 49.</p>

<p>Private George Williams, company F, came off the
field with his third gun&mdash;two having been shot from his
hands.</p>

<p>During August 10th and 11th skirmishing continued.
In the afternoon of the last-named day the 29th regiment
was inspected. Adjutant Storer reported eighty-three
men only present for duty.</p>

<p>The Union army remained on the field three days,
retiring, on August 12th, to Culpeper Court House,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
where it encamped. Our pickets, going over the battle
field on the 13th, reported that dead horses were piled
in promiscuous positions; dismounted cannons, wrecked
caissons, and broken fire-arms were everywhere, while
the graves of the fallen, singly and in trenches, were
scattered over the entire field, only the freshly heaped
up earth marking the spots. In one spot were the
unburied bodies of a boy in blue and one in gray, their
arms interlocked as their brave souls went out to the
God who gave them, the one for the right, the other, it
is hoped, forgiven for his misguided championship of
the wrong.</p>

<p>Twelfth, marched to Culpeper Court House, and went
into camp. 13th, put up tents and prepared to live.
14th, and all is quiet. 15th, another inspection and review.
There is one consolation if we do have inspection
every other day, there are so few men left that but
little time is consumed in doing so. 16th, 17th, and
18th, still in camp; was inspected again, and at 6 o'clock
on the evening of the latter day, struck tents under
orders to march; slept on our arms that night. 19th,
marched at 10 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span>, north to the Rappahannock, a distance
of eleven miles, and went into camp. Had only
a small quantity of green corn to eat. 20th, all quiet in
camp. 21st, at 6 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span> firing began, and was kept up
along the line all day; at 7 in the evening the regiment,
under command of Captain Schoonover, marched two
miles and halted; company H was sent forward to the
picket line, and the regiment moved at 6:30 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span> along
the Rappahannock; halted at 9:30; after a brief rest the
regiment again fell in, and marched till 12 at noon without
breakfast; sharp firing along the line; halted until
6 o'clock <span class="allsmcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span>; moved up the Rappahannock river
two miles, halted, stacked arms, and remained up nearly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
all night; (rainy) no tents or blankets, made our bed
of rails. Saturday, August 23d, at 6 o'clock <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span> the
artillery opened fire, and continued until 11 o'clock <span class="allsmcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span>;
remained on our arms all day; at 10 o'clock <span class="allsmcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span>
moved a short distance up the river, and the Twenty-ninth
went on picket. 24th, and all is quiet; at 9:30
<span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span> the artillery commenced firing, which was kept up
continually during the day. 25th, artillery and musketry
firing all along the line; at 8 o'clock <span class="allsmcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span> the Twenty-ninth
with its brigade moved up the river four miles and
camped for the night. 26th, no rations for breakfast,
but after a short time some green corn was procured,
which filled the bill. At 8 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span> the artillery dueling again
commenced and was kept up the remainder of the day.
The Twenty-ninth regiment moved one-half mile for
shelter, remained here until 9 <span class="allsmcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span>, when it marched
forward until 3 o'clock <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span>, of the 27th; halted, moved
forward a distance of three miles, and again halted. At
1 o'clock <span class="allsmcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span>, moved in the direction of Warrenton
Junction, and camped for the night (no rations for supper
or breakfast). On the morning of the 28th day of
August, the regiment moved at 5 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span>, marched three
miles and halted, drew rations and moved on in the
direction of Bristow station, and camped for the night.
Heavy firing in our advance all day. 29th, remained in
camp, about two miles above Bristow station. 30th,
marched at 6 o'clock <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span> and halted at Bristow station,
and remained till 5 o'clock <span class="allsmcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span>, when the enemy was
reported in our rear. The sick and disabled were moved
to Alexandria and other points. August 31st, teams and
trains containing camp and garrison equipage and other
army supplies, were moved in the direction of Fairfax
Court House.</p>

<p>During the campaign under Major-general Pope from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
August 20th until the regiment reached Alexandria on
the 2d day of September, 1862, it was one continuous
march and counter-march, by day and night, moving up
the Rappahannock as far as White Sulphur Springs. On
the 29th and 30th of August near the Bull Run battle
ground. A very hard battle was fought, in which the
Nationals were forced from the field, and again late in
the afternoon on the 1st day of September at Chantilly,
a short distance from Fairfax Court House, a sanguinary
battle was fought, which continued late in the evening.
In this last engagement the Nationals held the field at
night, and on the 2d the Union army fell back within
the fortifications around Washington city. During the
last two or three days of the above campaign the Twenty-ninth
regiment was completely cut off from the main
army, as it had been ordered to guard the quartermaster
stores with other government property on the railroad
at and near Bristow station, and when ordered to join its
brigade it found the enemy in the rear, so that it was
only by a circuitous route in the direction of Brintsville,
and a forced march that it reached the Chantilly battlefield
during the engagement, on September 1st.
Here it bivouacked for the night, and on the following
day marched to Arlington heights, via Alexandria, where
it went into camp.</p>

<p>During the last twelve days of the campaign the
Twenty-ninth suffered severely for rations and rest, it
being on the march, under fire, and on the skirmish line
the entire time. When we reached Fairfax station, on
the platform of the depot we found an immense table
upon which our wounded boys were being subjected to
the ofttimes bungling butchery of ignorant alleged
surgeons, a number of whom were busily engaged in
depriving the poor fellows under their charge of wounded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
legs and arms, and in many cases hastening their death
thereby. This worse than murder by men, the majority
of whom, when at home, had never even witnessed a
capital operation, cannot be too highly condemned.
(The writer is personally acquainted with professional
men of this sort, who came out of the service first-class
carvers, but the number of brave fellows sacrificed to
bring about this state of proficiency is unknown.) It
was now ascertained that the Confederate army of
General Lee was making rapid marches towards Maryland.
To checkmate this movement our columns were
at once ordered on a retrograde movement in the direction
of Washington. Reaching Alexandria, we passed
up the Potomac, crossing at the long bridge, and moving
forward to Georgetown where a halt of one day was
made, the command departing the following morning
for Frederick City, Maryland, which was said to be occupied
by the rebels. A day's march brought us beyond
Rockville, Maryland, where we encamped for the night.
At 2 o'clock, on the afternoon of September 5th, the
regiment marched to Monocacy Junction, where the
rebels had a short time previous destroyed the railroad
bridge.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center"><small>Frederick City&mdash;Recruits&mdash;Dumfries.</small></p>

<p>The regiment remained at Monocacy junction, guarding
the immense supply trains which had accumulated
here by reason of the burned bridge. Sergeant Baldwin
relates that a lot of rebel prisoners passed Monocacy
bridge, one of whom claimed to have fired seven
shots at Colonel Buckley at the battle of Port Republic,
but without effect. About September 13th, the bridge
having been replaced, we moved on to Frederick city,
Maryland. Here we engaged in camp, picket, and provost
duty, and a large number of the men were detailed
to care for the wounded from the battlefields of South
Mountain and Antietam, September 14th and 17th.</p>

<p>In the meantime we were joined by a large number of
recruits, amongst which was a brigade cornet band, composed
of the following members: George Shaw, leader;
Everett Shaw, assistant leader; J. G. Caskey, Jacob
Koplin, Sylvanus Hile, Columbus Ferguson, N. G.
Hartman, Christian Hardag, William Kurtz, George
Metcalf, James Lyon, "Bige" Nickerson, Benjamin
Snyder, George Turney, Micajah Rice, Bennett Wadsworth,
Edward White, Frank Waltz, Eli Waltz; Gurley
G. Crane, drum major.</p>

<p>November 25th, Colonel Clark says: "Patiently
waiting in camp. 'Dress parade' to-day, the first many
of us have seen since May last. Only about two hundred
men in line. Remembering how far our line
reached at Camp Giddings, our force looks small indeed."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span></p>

<p>November 27th. "Cold and raw. A fierce gale
makes our canvas houses rock like cradles. We are
now having an easy time; that is all but the men and the
mules. Our men go on duty every other day. As to
rations, don't think any of us will get the gout."</p>

<p>November 27th. "Thanksgiving.&mdash;'Distance lends
enchantment,' etc., to turkeys, chickens, pies, and fixin's
that make good cheer at home. Well, some of us
are thankful&mdash;that we are here instead of being locked
up in those dirty rebel prisons. Nine of our officers and
a large number of our men have just been released.
This inactivity is irksome to the volunteer who has
business at home needing his attention. We hardly
think Burnside will reach Richmond via Fredericksburg
unless he goes as some of us did&mdash;as prisoners."</p>

<p>On the 10th day of December, 1862, the regiment
struck tents at Frederick City, Maryland, and moved by
cars in the direction of Harper's Ferry. At Sandy
Hook a halt was made for the night; slept in freight
cars; suffered severely from cold. The following day
marched at 6 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span> About noon crossed the Potomac
and Shenandoah rivers into Virginia; marched about nine
miles and camped for the night. Twelfth, marched at 3
<span class="allsmcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span> some nine miles and went into camp. Thirteenth,
moved at 6 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span>, marched twelve miles, halted for dinner,
passed through Leesburg, and camped for the night.
Fourteenth, marched at sunrise, passed through Fairfax
Court House to the station, where we encamped.
Fifteenth, marched till about 4 <span class="allsmcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span>, crossed Broad run
and encamped for the night. Sixteenth, marched four
miles in rain, snow, and mud; at 12 <span class="allsmcap">M.</span> halted for dinner;
had a fight with a Pennsylvania regiment over some
rails that had been collected from the fence. These we
used for wood occasionally in preparing our meals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span></p>

<p>[It] is perhaps unnecessary to mention that the Twenty-ninth
boys enjoyed good fires to-day. In the afternoon
the Twenty-ninth went on picket one mile to the rear.
Seventeenth, brigade counter-marched to Fairfax station,
where it remained until the 19th, when it moved southeast
about one and one-half miles to an orchard, where
it encamped, and where it remained until the 27th,
when it marched at 9 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span>; reached Broad run
late in the evening. On the hill on the south side of
the creek was a fort occupied by rebels; the Twenty-ninth
crossed the creek, halted, loaded their guns, and
advanced, and a red-hot little skirmish ensued at the
close of which the rebels fell back. We went into the
fort, sending two companies out in the road leading
towards Dumfries as skirmishers. The regiment remained
on arms all night; cold and frosty. Guns are
not very warm bed-fellows. Twenty-eighth, marched at
7:30 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span>, Twenty-ninth in advance of division. About
10 o'clock met some rebel cavalry; the Twenty-ninth
regiment deployed into line of battle, a few shots were
fired, and the rebels fell back. One man wounded in
company A. While in this position Generals Slocum,
Geary, and Green came up; a battery was soon in position
which sent a few shots after the retreating rebel
cavalry. In the afternoon marched through the woods
on right of road, in line of battle, while the division
moved in the road; skirmishing the balance of the day.
At dark we halted three miles from Dumfries and
camped for the night. Twenty-ninth, reached Dumfries'
about 10 o'clock <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span>, and went into camp on the side
hill in the woods north of town.</p>

<p>January 1, 1863, the regiment and its brigade remained
at Dumfries, doing camp and picket duty, until
January 16th, when it was ordered to march on two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
hours' notice, did not march. On the 17th and 18th
nothing transpired worthy of note. On the 19th the
regiment passed in grand review by Colonel Charles
Canby, of the Sixty-sixth Ohio infantry. January 27th,
General Geary visited the regiment while on parade, and
complimented us on our discipline, neat appearance, and
soldierly deportment. February 2nd, Colonel L. P.
Buckley, Adjutant T. S. Winship, Captain E. Burridge
and Lieutenant Gregory, of company F, resigned and
went home. Lieutenant J. B. Storer was made adjutant,
and Sergeant H. R. Baldwin, of company F, promoted
to captain. February 3d, Companies D and I
were detached at Dumfries landing, on the Potomac,
about four miles from camp, doing guard duty, unloading
army supplies from boats, and loading the Second
Division trains.</p>

<p>On the 14th some musketry firing was heard in the
direction of Brentsville.</p>

<p>March 9th, Eli Waltz, of Company D, and a member
of the brigade band, died.</p>

<p>April 16th, Companies D and I moved from the landing,
and joined the regiment.</p>

<p>From the 29th day of December, 1862, the time when
the Twenty-ninth regiment entered Dumfries, its duties
were severe; the line of pickets was over three miles
long, and over one mile from camp; and as the rebel
cavalry were hovering around, the main roads entering
Dumfries, were patroled at night. Our men suffered
severely from cold and the protracted storms. In the
meantime five companies were added to the brigade.
The Twenty-eighth Pennsylvania originally had fifteen
companies; five companies were added to the new recruits,
and designated the One Hundred and Forty-seventh
Pennsylvania, with Ario Pardee as colonel. Our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
first brigade now consists of the Twenty-ninth, Seventh,
Fifth, and Sixty-sixth Ohio regiments, and Twenty-eighth
and One Hundred and Forty-seventh Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>The suffering our men endured during our stay at
Dumfries from inclemency of the weather, the arduous
service, and the scarcity of almost every necessity,
cannot be easily over-estimated, and it might with propriety
go into history as a counterpart of that much
written about, and extensively illustrated affair "Washington
at Valley Forge."</p>

<p>About the 20th day of April, 1863, with Colonel
Clark in command, the Twenty-ninth regiment, with its
brigade, left Dumfries, Virginia, and marched to Aqua
creek, which place it reached two days later, and encamped
about one mile from the Potomac river. Aqua
creek is sixty miles below Washington on the river; it
was used as a base for supplies, and a field hospital was
soon established. The regiment with its brigade remained
at this place performing the usual camp and garrison
duty, building forts and, at the same time, doing its
full share of picket duty. We are encamped on the hill
overlooking the Potomac. To the north and west is a
fine rolling country partly covered with pine timber and
tangled undergrowth. All was quiet until orders were
received to march; then what a bustle; haversacks were
filled, each soldier furnished with sixty rounds of ammunition,
and preparations made for "business." At 7
o'clock <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span>, on the 27th day of April, the regiment fell
into line and moved forward on the road leading to
Kelleys ford via Stafford Court House and Hartwood
church, reaching the Rappahannock river at Kelley's
ford late in the afternoon. The enemy was found in
small force on the south bank of the river. Late in the
evening the Sixty-sixth Ohio regiment crossed the river<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
in a small boat capable of carrying but one company at
a time. The regiment deployed as skirmishers, holding
the enemy back until the division had all crossed when
we bivouacked for the night. The next morning we
marched at 5:30 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span>, the Twenty-ninth regiment in
advance; passed through a low, level country, with
heavy timber; halted at 12 <span class="allsmcap">M.</span> for dinner at a fine residence
on a large plantation; fell in at 1:30 <span class="allsmcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span> and
moved in an easterly direction, reaching the Rapidan
river late in the afternoon. The bridge had been destroyed,
so that a crossing was not effected until in the
evening, after which the Twenty-ninth camped for the
night. 29th instant,&mdash;marched at 7:30 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span> on the
direct road to Chancellorsville. About 10 o'clock <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span>
General Slocum came up and orders were received for
the Twenty-ninth regiment to send out a line of skirmishers
on the right of the road, which was done, the
regiment passing through an open field and entering
the timber, forcing the enemy back; marched on the
flank through the woods and thick undergrowth for
several miles, were then ordered to join the brigade.
We reached Chancellorsville late in the afternoon of
April 30th, where we found a small force of Confederate
soldiers who were engaged in throwing up earthworks
near the Chancellor house, at a point where the
roads crossed, one leading to the United States ford,
and the other to Fredericksburg. The Twenty-ninth
regiment, with its brigade and division, were the first
Union soldiers to enter the place. A number of prisoners
were taken, and late in the evening the Twenty-ninth
moved a short distance southwest from the main road
and the Chancellor house into a piece of timber and
bivouacked for the night.</p>

<p class="center">1863.</p>

<p class="center"><small>Battle of Chancellorsville&mdash;March to Leesburg, Littletown, and
Gettysburg.</small></p>

<p>The morning of May 1st dawned upon a scene of bustle
and active preparation for the bloody work which was
to follow. Troops had been arriving during the entire
night from the direction of the United States ford, and
the light of early morning revealed an almost solid mass
of blue-coated soldiers filling the open fields and woods
in the vicinity of the Chancellor house. They were
mainly from the Fifth, Eleventh, and Twelfth corps. At
about 8 o'clock <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span> the Twenty-ninth, with its brigade
and division, made a reconnoissance in force, and after
marching about one-half mile the division formed in
line of battle, and in this position was moved about the
field until afternoon, when the lines were generally
moved to the east through the timber, the right resting
on the road. Moving perhaps half a mile we found
the enemy in strong force, his artillery masked in
the road. During this time some skirmishing and
artillery firing was indulged in, and several of the
Twenty-ninth were wounded. Late in the afternoon we
moved to the rear under a heavy fire from the rebel
artillery. Reaching the place we had left in the morning
we set to work throwing up breastworks. The rebels
advanced and our skirmishers kept up a rattling fire
all night, while the regiment worked like beavers preparing
the works for the coming conflict. The Second<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
division, commanded by John W. Geary, occupied about
the left center in the order of battle.</p>

<p>During the evening of May 1st the Confederate army
were charging the right of our lines, and for four hours
the artillery firing on both sides was terrific. It continued
at intervals the entire night. The air was ablaze
and full of deadly missiles dealing destruction all around
us; the earth trembled under our feet; the rattle and
roar of artillery was like continued bursts of thunder.
The heavens seemed on fire, revealing the deadly strife
of two grand armies locked in close embrace, fighting
with desperate valor. The dense smoke was lightened
by rapid flashes of artillery, the bursting of shell, and the
unceasing discharges of musketry, making a scene grand
and terrible in the extreme. At midnight this deadly
combat ceased, the death-like stillness which succeeded
being broken only by the cries of the wounded and the
dying comrades so recently beside us in deadly combat.
About 1 o'clock at night pickets were posted forty yards
from the main line. We were so near the rebel pickets
we could hear every movement. Here we lay flat on
the ground watching for demonstrations of the enemy
until the dawning of another day of blood and death.
In the first flush of early morning the rebels advanced
with columns <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en masse</i> and at once opened fire on us.
This we returned and then quickly retired under a storm
of leaden hail. Leaping over the rifle-pits we soon
rejoined the command.</p>

<p>The Twenty-ninth regiment now moved in a southwesterly
direction along the line of works a short distance,
in support of a New York regiment. While supporting
this regiment the Twenty-ninth was under artillery fire
from the right flank. Colonel Clark was struck by a
shell, and rendered unconscious nearly two hours. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
regiment again moved into its old position on the road
south of the Chancellorsville house, where it remained
under heavy fire of artillery and musketry, and in the
afternoon our right flank was turned, and the Union
army was soon forced back in the direction of the river,
at Banks' ford. When the Twenty-ninth fell back the
rebels were in possession of the Chancellor house, and
there were not one hundred Union soldiers in sight.
The army fell back about one mile and a half, filling the
woods and the road leading to Banks' ford. Here it
took a strong position and threw up a line of works and
remained until May 6th, when, after being on arms all
night, it marched at 6 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span>, crossed the river at Banks'
ford, and camped for the night.</p>

<p>During the three days' fight the Twenty-ninth regiment
lost quite heavily; the killed were four, wounded
forty-two, and prisoners twenty-five.</p>

<p>In this action the rebel loss was officially reported in
killed, wounded, and missing, as upward of 10,000 men,
while the Union loss was about the same. The rebel
loss in killed and wounded was greater than ours, in
addition to which they lost one of their ablest generals.</p>

<p>May 7th, marched at 6:30 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span> It rained hard all
day. We passed Hartwood church, Staffordshire, and
went into camp near Aqua creek, and here it remained
until June 3d, when the regiment moved to the south
about one mile, and engaged in the construction of two
small forts.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of June 13th, we received orders
to march. Tents were struck, but it was not until late
in the afternoon that we moved, and then marched during
the whole night, reaching Dumfries after daylight on
the morning of the 14th.</p>

<p>15th, march at 4 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span> Halted on the north bank of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
the Occoquan creek for dinner. Resuming the march
in the afternoon we passed Fairfax station and Court
House on the road leading to Leesburg (marched
twenty-five miles). This was a march of much suffering
to the men, several of whom died during the day from
sunstrokes.</p>

<p>16th. Remained in camp all day.</p>

<p>17th. March in the direction of Leesburg. Halted
at 12 <span class="allsmcap">M.</span>, and camped for the night.</p>

<p>June 18th. Marched to near Leesburg and went into
camp. <em>Oh! How it rains!</em></p>

<p>19th. Remained in camp cleaning up guns and equipage,
and all is quiet. In the afternoon the Twelfth
army corps were ordered out to witness the shooting
of three deserters from the First division of the Twelfth
army corps. Following are the names: William McKee,
company A, Forty-sixth Pennsylvania; Christopher
Krumbart, company A, Forty-sixth Pennsylvania; and
William Grover, company B, Thirteenth New Jersey.
Lieutenant-colonel Clark left us here badly broken
down in health.</p>

<p>Sunday, June 20th. In camp cleaning up for inspection.
21st and 22d in camp. 23d, 24th and 25th,
Captain Schoonover, in charge of one hundred and
twenty men from the brigade, felling timber, uncovering
Ball's Bluff in front of Fort Beauregard.</p>

<p>26th. The regiment left Leesburg, crossing the Potomac
at Edward's Ferry, passed Poolsville, and encamped
for the night at Monocacy aqueduct.</p>

<p>27th. Moved at 4:30 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span> by way of Point of Rocks,
Petersville and Parkersburg, and camped for the night
five miles from Harper's Ferry.</p>

<p>28th. Moved in the forenoon, passing through Harper's
Ferry, then up the tow path of the Baltimore &amp;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
Ohio canal to Clear Springs, where the Twenty-ninth
passed under the canal through a culvert, and moving in
the direction of Frederick City, Maryland, went into
camp.</p>

<p>29th. Moved through Frederick City in the direction
of Pennsylvania, and went into camp. General
Hooker was relieved from command of the Army of the
Potomac, and General George G. Mead placed in command.</p>

<p>30th. Moved north into Pennsylvania, and late in
the afternoon reached Littlestown, where we had a skirmish
with the advance guard of the rebel Lee, which
falling back toward Gettysburg, we moved north of
town; mustered for pay and went into camp for the
night.</p>

<p class="center"><small>Gettysburg.</small></p>

<p class="center">1863.</p>

<p>July 1, 1863, the Twenty-ninth regiment, under command
of Captain Edward Hayes, marched at 6:30 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span>,
passed through Littletown and on towards Gettysburg.
After moving some five miles, we halted, and while
preparing for dinner, first heard the distant artillery firing
which seemed to be many miles away.</p>

<p>While resting, troops were passing to the front.
Meanwhile some of Company H had advanced to an
eminence, from which they soon returned, reporting that
the cannonading was not far off, as they could plainly
see the shells as they burst above the timber. We were
soon on the march, halting occasionally to breathe, as it
was excessively hot and dusty. When about two miles
from Gettysburg, we met ambulances returning with the
wounded of the First and Eleventh corps, which had
been engaged. Advancing a short distance, we found
still further evidence of the fight in the bodies of those
who had been killed in battle, and left beside the road.
Late in the afternoon the Twenty-ninth reached the
Union lines near Seminary Hill, and here batteries were
in position. The troops were moving, and the rapid
forming of lines gave evidence that a <em>battle</em> was <em>nigh</em>.</p>

<p>The Twenty-ninth regiment filed to the left of the pike,
and advancing about forty rods, took a position in a
wheat field, in line of battle, and here remained on arms
during the night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span></p>

<p>During the day (July 1st) the First corps, commanded
by General J. F. Reynolds, had a sharp fight, in which
Reynolds was killed. The Eleventh corps (Howard's)
was also engaged. Late in the afternoon the Nationals
were pressed back, and took a strong position a short
distance from Gettysburg, on Seminary Ridge, which
ended the battle for that day.</p>

<p>During the night we could hear the moving of confederate
troops and artillery in our front, while at the
same time the Nationals were coming onto the field, so
that in the morning of July 2d, the open field and
woods presented a solid mass of troops, artillery and
supply trains.</p>

<p>About 8 o'clock <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span>, July 2d, the Twenty-ninth
regiment moved back to the pike, and moved with the
division to a position in the timber on a hill, near the
right of the line. Here breastworks were thrown up, and
skirmishing was almost continuous along the line during
the forenoon, and until about 3 o'clock <span class="allsmcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span>, when the
struggle was renewed on the left, and gradually extended
to the center. About 6 o'clock <span class="allsmcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span>, there was a lull on
the left, and the fight raged with renewed vigor on the
extreme right and center, with Howard's Eleventh and
Slocum's Twelfth corps. Late in the evening the
Twenty-ninth, with the brigade, withdrew from the works,
and moved back about three-fourths of a mile, where it
remained during the forepart of the night, moving back
and forth, and constantly skirmishing. The entire army
appeared to be in motion the greater part of the night.</p>

<p>July 3, 1863, at the dawn of day, the Twenty-ninth,
with the brigade, moved back to, and took position in
the works left the night before, and about 4 o'clock <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span>
the conflict was renewed.</p>

<p>The rebels who had possession of our works were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
quickly driven back, and, fifteen minutes after the first
gun was fired, the engagement became general along the
entire line, and for six hours the musketry was one continued
roll, interspersed at intervals by the crash of the
artillery. The Twenty-ninth remained in the works except
when allowed to retire to secure ammunition, clean
pieces, etc. While thus securing ammunition the rebels
charged the line on our right, gained possession of the
works, and were advancing in force, when that gallant
officer, Colonel Hayes, ordered the Twenty-ninth to fall
in, fix bayonets, and advance to the charge of the rebels
in the rifle pits and advancing on our right. The regiment
made a half wheel to the right and advanced
double-quick, when the rebels gave way. An eastern
shore regiment took position next on our right, holding
the rebels in check. A battery was immediately placed in
position, a few rounds from which sent the Confederates
to the rear, leaving their dead and wounded thick about
our line of works.</p>

<p>The Confederates in our front were Ewell's corps, including
our old acquaintance, Stonewall Jackson's brigade,
which fought with desperation. The rattle of the
musketry, which extended from the extreme right to the
left center of our line, had now become continuous, and
about 1 o'clock <span class="allsmcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span> General Lee opened a furious fire
upon our lines from over one hundred and fifty pieces
of artillery, to which more than one hundred National
guns quickly responded; some sixty thousand small arms
were heard amidst the roar of artillery. This unearthly
din continued until late in the afternoon, when the firing
ceased except at intervals, and this continued during
the entire night.</p>

<p>Brevet Captain George Hayward, of company E, promoted
for gallant conduct at Chancellorsville, was killed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
in this fight. He was daring almost to rashness, always
at the front, unmindful of danger, while his tender
solicitude for his men endeared him to all who knew
him, and his death was sincerely regretted. The rebel
who killed him was concealed in the crevice of the rock
not more than twenty paces from our line. Upon again
exposing his person not less than one hundred rifles were
discharged at him; he sprang backward, a shrill cry
rang out upon the air, and brave Hayward's death was
avenged.</p>

<p>A little further down the hill lay the dead body of
Major Light, assistant adjutant-general on Ewell's staff,
who had perished in the morning assault.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of July 4th the Twenty-ninth
regiment advanced in reconnoissance over the battlefield,
and for the first time gained a full knowledge of the
fearful loss of life the rebels had sustained, full five
thousand of whom had answered to their last roll-call.
Still the mystery exists how any rebels escaped, as each
soldier of the Union army had, in the seven hours' fight,
fired two hundred and fifty rounds of ammunition, sufficient
to have annihilated the entire Southern army.</p>

<p>We moved forward to the base of Culp's hill, and
thence left, to the creek near Cemetery hill, on the opposite
bank of which were posted the gray-coated pickets
of the enemy. Rebel troops were moving through
the town, while a force was fortified on Seminary ridge.
Pickets were thrown out to observe their movements and
we retired to the main line.</p>

<p>During the day nearly five thousand stand of rebel
arms were collected from the field, in front of Geary's
division alone. Our fallen comrades were tenderly,
though rudely, transferred to the kindly embrace of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
mother earth, while the wounded were collected at convenient
points to receive the necessary treatment.</p>

<p>Whoever has followed the phases of the battle of
Gettysburg must have been expressed with the stubborn
valor displayed on both sides by the common soldiers.
The dauntless resolution exhibited in the attacks made
it a terribly bloody and destructive conflict, and the
unyielding and resolute front of the defence brought
victory. But there was no possibility of achieving on
either side such sweeping and complete triumphs as are
recorded of wars in other countries and in other days, in
a contest between two armies where the common soldiers
were of such a temper and in such earnest as were these.
It is a sad spectacle to see the manhood of two claiming
to be Christian peoples thus march out to a field, like
trained pugilists, and beat, and gouge, and pummel each
other until one or the other from exhaustion must yield.
It is revolting and sickening, and it is hoped that the
day will come when disputes arising among nations may
be settled by compromise, as two reasonable and upright
men would decide a difference, governed by the golden
rule, instead of resorting to blows where right and justice
must be subordinate to brute force. But in a great
battle like that which we have been considering it is not
the soldiers themselves who are responsible, but the
parties who make the quarrel. Hence, while the mind
revolts at the scenes of destruction which the field discloses,
the immediate actors are not to be held accountable.
They go in obedience to the dictates of duty and
of patriotism, and while they may indulge no personal
hatred toward those who for the time they call enemies,
they must in battle inflict the greatest possible injury
upon them. In all ages the highest honors have been
reserved for those who have fought the battles of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
country&mdash;and this is right. For if there is any deed in
the power of a mortal which can sway the feelings or
soften the heart it is that of one man laying down his
life for another. The breast heaves and the eye is suffused
with tears at the spectacle of Pythias putting his
life in jeopardy only for his friend. There is a halo of
glory hovering about the profession of arms. It has its
seat in the sacrifice of self, which is its ruling spirit.</p>

<p>The man who stands upon the field of battle and faces
the storm of death that sweeps along, whether he merely
puts his life thus in jeopardy or is actually carried down
in death, torn and mangled in the dread fight, is worthy
of endless honors, and though we class the deed with
the lowest of human acts, prompted by a hardihood
which we share with the brutes, and in which the most
ignorant and besotted may compete with the loftiest, yet
it is an act before which humanity will ever bow and
uncover. Who that walked that field of carnage and
beheld the maimed and mangled, and him cold in death,
could withhold the tribute of honor and respect? For,
could he make that dying soldier's lot his own, or that of
his nearest and dearest friend, he would only then justly
realize the sacrifice. Our casualties in the fight were:
Killed, nine; wounded, thirty-five; missing, one. Total,
forty-five.</p>

<p class="center"><small>Return to Washington&mdash;Embark for New York&mdash;Return&mdash;Transferred
to the Western Army.</small></p>

<p>The pursuit of the retreating enemy was commenced
by the Twelfth army corps at 1 o'clock <span class="allsmcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span>, on July 5th.
At night we encamped at Littletown, Pennsylvania, and
on the following morning moved by the way of Frederick
to Antietam creek. On the 7th instant we marched
through Frederick, filed to the right, and passed by a
rebel spy that was hanging to a limb of a tree. We
moved a short distance, and halted, where we remained
all night. On the 8th we marched over the mountains
in the direction of Sharpsburg. On the 9th we passed
over the battlefield, and camped near Fairplay, Maryland.
On the 10th we moved through the town, and
camped for the night near Falling waters. On the following
day we advanced to Fairplay, a small town to the
south of St. James' college, and the Twenty-ninth regiment,
with its customary good (?) fortune, was thrown out
as skirmishers, and during the day exchanged frequent
shots with the enemy's cavalry, and at night resting in
position on the extreme front.</p>

<p>During the night rebel cavalry approached very near
our line, but our orders were positive not to fire unless
attacked. On the following morning we were relieved
and retired to the main line, where we assumed position
as support to Knapp's battery, which was hotly engaged
at intervals during the day.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 13th instant we rejoined our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
brigade, anticipating an attack. Riflepits were thrown up
and due preparation made. The enemy are strongly
fortified between St. James' college and Williamsport,
some two miles distant, and on the 14th he was reported
as falling back across the Potomac. Heavy cannonading
is heard towards the river, and the First division of
General Williams advances in reconnoissance, the Second
acting as support. A dispatch states that Lee's army, in
full retreat, began crossing the river yesterday, continued
through the night and to-day. Our troops are hotly engaged
with his rear guard, and we remain in position
until the morning of the 18th, when we move briskly forward
in pursuit of the fleeing chivalry, who were now
across the Potomac in Virginia. We marched via
Sharpsburg and Antietam.</p>

<p>While passing through the woods three men were shot
by Mosby's cavalry. A march of sixteen miles and we
halt within three miles of Harper's Ferry. At Sandy
Hook we remain until the morning of the 19th instant,
when we move forward via Harper's Ferry, to Hillsboro,
Virginia.</p>

<p>On the following morning we are early on the move,
advancing as far as Snickersville, near the gap of that
name, where pickets are thrown out and we bivouac for
the night. We remain here for two days, during which
time we muster and pass in review. Colonel W. T.
Fitch recently promoted, and who has been absent on
leave since March 28th, joined us here, and assumed
command.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 23d we again moved forward,
passing through Upperville and on to Ashby's gap,
where, at a late hour, we go into camp. Having marched
thirty miles since morning sleep was sweet that night,
with mother earth for a bed, and only heaven's blue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
canopy for a cover. At 3 o'clock on the morning of the
24th we march rapidly forward through the villages of
Markham and Linden, halting for dinner at Manassas
gap, then forward, changing direction by column to the
south-southeast, in the direction of White Plains.
Marching sixteen miles we halted for the night.</p>

<p>The next day we marched to White Plains, and the
next by the way of Thoroughfare gap, Haymarket, and
Greenwich, the latter a pretty little village, settled by
English people, for whose protection guards were stationed,
as they were in fact in many instances for the
protection of rebel property. After a brief halt we
marched forward via Catlett's station and Warrenton,
where we joined the First and Eleventh corps of our
army and encamped for the night, then forward again to
Kelley's Ford, on the Rappahannock, when, after a short
visit, the brigade took cars for Alexandria, Virginia,
under orders for New York city, to quell the memorable
draft riots induced by the Southern sympathizers and
copperheads.</p>

<p>On August 23d we embarked on the steamer Baltic
and moved down the Potomac. When near its outlet
we went fast aground. This action occurred about noon
on the 24th, and three days elapsed before we were
again on the move. On the 28th, at 9:45 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span>, we
round Cape Henry and strike the swells of the Atlantic.
A rough sea soon sends many of the command to the
rail to&mdash;well, if the reader was ever seasick he will appreciate
the situation. It is not pleasant to linger long
upon this scene; the recollection of it, even now, almost
destroys one's interest in sublunary affairs.</p>

<p>On the 29th we pass the narrows and enter New York
harbor, coming to anchor near Governor's Island at 12
o'clock <span class="allsmcap">M.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span></span></p>

<p>From our anchorage the view was grandly beautiful
with the immense shipping, Brooklyn on the right, New
York to the front, and Jersey City on the left. On the
left of Governor's Island Castle William (now used as a
magazine) stands out in bold relief. To its right is the
fort which protects the harbor. On September 1st we
disembarked and went into camp on the island. The
men are in fine spirits and delighted with the change.</p>

<p>The troubles in the city having subsided we re-embarked
aboard the Baltic, which, on the 8th day of September,
heads towards the sea. When passing the narrows
the guns of the fort thunder a salute; soon Sandy
Hook is passed and we are again in the open sea, all
happy at the prospect of going to the front, the inactivity
of camp life with nothing to do having become tiresome
in the extreme.</p>

<p>On September 10th we came to anchor in Chesapeake
Bay, where we remained one day, then passed on again
to Alexandria, disembarked, and went into camp to the
south of the town. Two days later and we again move
forward to Elk creek, where we encamp for the night.</p>

<p>September 16th, marched at 6 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span>, reached the Rappahannock
at noon, and here rejoined our old brigade,
moved forward to Raccoon ford on the north side of the
Rapidan. General Lee's forces are massed on the opposite
shore of the river, and as we came up our ears
were greeted with the pleasing sound of rapid musketry
firing proceeding from the pickets of the two armies.
During the afternoon we witnessed the execution of two
deserters from the Seventy-eighth New York.</p>

<p>During the last of September we learned of the defeat
of the Western army at Chickamauga, and the Twelfth
corps was at once transferred to the Department of the
West, and without delay proceeded by rail to Washington,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
and thence via Wheeling, Columbus, Indianapolis,
Nashville, to Murfreesboro, Tennessee, where we arrived
October 5th.</p>

<p>After a few days' rest the regiment again resume the
march, passing Duck river, Bell Buckle, and Wartrace,
when the Seventh Ohio halted, while the Twenty-ninth
moved on to Normandy, on the Nashville &amp; Chattanooga
railroad. Here it remained in camp, with the usual
routine of camp and picket duty until late in October,
when the regiment and brigade broke camp, took the
cars for Bridgeport, Alabama, where it arrived on the
27th, disembarked, and camped for the night. On the
morning of October 28th the Twenty-ninth regiment
crossed the Tennessee river with the wagon train. Halting
at Shellmound for dinner, marched until late in the
evening, and halted near White Sides, where all camped
for the night. About 11 o'clock <span class="allsmcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span> artillery firing,
with heavy volleys of musketry, was heard in the direction
of Chattanooga, continuing two or three hours.</p>

</div>

<p class="center"><small>Murfreesboro&mdash;General Greene&mdash;The Mule Brigade&mdash;Congratulatory.</small></p>

<p>While at Murfreesboro scouts reported that Wheeler's
cavalry was in the vicinity, and the Second division
(Geary's) was pushed forward to meet it, the First division
remaining to guard the post and railway communication.
Geary moved forward in the direction of Bridgeport,
encountering Wheeler's force near the line of the
railway. A brief but sharp skirmish ensued, which resulted
in the repulse and hasty retreat of the rebels. We
then advanced without delay to Bridgeport. October
27th the Second division, Geary commanding, with
Creighton and Greene in command of the First and
Second brigades, crossed the Tennessee, the object to
open communication on the south side of the river by
way of Wauhatchie valley and Lookout mountain for the
relief of General Thomas at Chattanooga.</p>

<p>Brigadier-general Greene, with three regiments of
infantry and four pieces of Knapp's battery, numbering
about fifteen hundred men, with a wagon train of provisions,
was sent to the relief of the famishing army at
Chattanooga, the balance of our command following as
fast as practicable with the immense supply train in
charge. After we had encamped for the night the signal
corps of General Greene informed us that his command
had encamped at Wauhatchie, within six miles of Chattanooga.
The knoll occupied by them derived its name
from an Indian battle fought there years before. It is
situated in the valley not far from the base of Lookout
mountain. Knapp's guns were placed in position facing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
Lookout, and pickets stationed perhaps fifty yards to the
front.</p>

<p>About midnight General Hood's division came down
from the heights of Lookout and quietly surrounded
General Greene's small force, and at once commenced
an attack. Greene's men, aroused from their slumber,
hastily formed line under a most deadly fire from all
sides, and one of the most desperate struggles on record
ensued. We were awakened by the sound of the distant
combat, and forming into line hastily advanced to their
rescue. When we arrived Hood's rebels had been
routed and were flying in all directions, intent only on
reaching their mountain stronghold. There was a regular
stampede of the mules, which had broken loose and
were braying furiously. This, with loud shouts from our
men, must have induced a belief in the valorous rebel
horde that a large force of cavalry was charging down
upon them, and their fears and flight was indeed a grand
burlesque finale to a terrible tragedy.</p>

<p>General Greene had lost one-third of his force, killed
and wounded, his ammunition was exhausted, and ordering
the mules cut loose, he made a desperate bayonet
charge to cut his way to freedom. The mules providentially
moved in the same direction, mingling the thunder
of their tread and their awful voices with the shouts of
Greene's men, and our own, to let them know that assistance
was coming. The effect was to throw Hood's rebel
army into a wild panic and put them to rout. Three
hundred prisoners and about one thousand stand of
arms were captured. Every man of Knapp's battery,
save one only, was either killed or wounded. Among
the former was Lieutenant Geary, son of General John
W. Geary. The ground was covered with the dead and
injured of both the blue and the gray.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span></p>

<p>While assisting the wounded and burying the dead,
Generals Grant, Hooker, and Thomas, with their respective
staffs, arrived from Chattanooga. The former
coolly remarked as he surveyed the bloody scene:
"Well, boys, you must have had a hot time of it, judging
from appearances." There was silence among the
men, who knew that an army was cosily reposing but
four miles away, which could easily have averted the
terrible bloodshed, but were so completely disheartened
by the defeat at Chickamauga that they dare not venture
from their stronghold to the relief of gallant "Corporal"
Greene, who happily turned defeat into a heroic victory.</p>

<p>The following lines, composed by one of our command,

<p>Major-general George H. Thomas issued an order
complimenting the column under Major-general Hooker,
which took possession of the line from Bridgeport to the
foot of Lookout Mountain, for their brilliant success in
driving the enemy from every position which they attacked.
The repulse by General Geary's command of
the greatly superior numbers who attempted to surprise
him, will rank among the most distinguished feats of
arms of the war.</p>

<p>We moved forward the next evening, and threw up a

</div>

<p class="center"><small>Lookout Mountain&mdash;The Battle&mdash;The Regiment Re-enlist.</small></p>

<p>The line of General Geary's division now extends
along the foot of Lookout mountain, parallel with the
rebel line, and only separated from it by the creek along
its base. For nearly ten days the commissary stores intended
for us have been largely forwarded to Chattanooga,
leaving us with scarcely anything to eat. When
on the skirmish line we often sent our reserves around
to the right of the mountain to secure corn from a field
in that location, held by the rebels, and quite lively little
fights would result. Our boys always returned with
corn, however, which we parched to allay in part the
bitter pangs of hunger. As with everything earthly our
long fast ended, rations came, and life began to seem
almost worth living, exchanges of coffee and tobacco
were almost hourly made between the Union and rebel
soldiers, each forgetting for the time the hate engendered
over the fight for corn. Our main line was being strongly
fortified, the rebels meanwhile keeping up an almost
continuous bombardment of our line from their batteries
on the heights of Lookout. Strong details were
employed in cutting away the forest on our front to enable
our artillery to cover an hourly expected attack.
The situation remained the same until November 23d,
when, toward night, the beat of the "long roll" called
Geary's division to arms. It at once moved promptly
forward, formed line of battle, facing Lookout heights,
and advanced to its base along the creek. Osterhaus'<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
division of the Fifteenth corps, and Whittaker's brigade,
of the Fourth corps, now advanced to the left of Geary's
division. The rebels soon discovered this movement
and promptly moved a strong force down the mountain
side within easy musket range, where they strongly
fortified during the night.</p>

<p>The morning of November 24th opened out a simultaneous
discharge of our entire artillery, which was
parked along the mountain's point, the infantry on our
left advancing to the base of the mountain. The First
brigade, led by Colonel Creighton, and followed by the
Second and Third brigades, moved rapidly up the creek
to the right under cover of the woods, then debouching
to the left. The First brigade took the advance and began
the ascent of Lookout heights, being favored by a
friendly ravine extending toward the crest of the mountain.
The brigade had advanced perhaps two-thirds of
the distance before the enemy discovered its movements,
and now the men renew their efforts, driving the enemy
before them despite the terrible fire poured into our advance,
and after a desperate struggle reach the rocky
crest and disappear in a thick mist (referred to by most
writers, we believe, as clouds, and which gave this engagement
the title of the "battle above the clouds").
The line of the whole division is extended, and in a
moment sweeps down in an impetuous charge on both
the rebel flank and rear. Their batteries are reached,
the cannoniers beaten back, and the guns captured. Onward,
upward, with loud cheers our columns rush to victory,
carrying everything before them. A whole brigade
is captured, and Lookout mountain, since famous in
song and story, is ours. This victory was won by
Geary's men, assisted only by Whittaker's brigade acting
as support. The troops below now came gallantly(?) up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
the mountain to claim, as usual, the honors won, as the
voluminous reports subsequently written by their generals
amply attest. Geary and his brigade commanders
had no reports to make save that their division stormed
the heights and carried them, capturing the enemy's
artillery and the entire rebel force occupying the main
defenses of the mountain. Some time after the capture
the standard of the "white star" division was planted on
the crest and the stars and stripes was soon waving beside
it. No danger was incurred by this, as none of the
enemy remained except the prisoners, yet it has been
written and rewritten as if it were an event of some importance.</p>

<p>"The morning of November 25th revealed the white
star standard of Geary and the glorious old stars and
stripes to the army below, floating triumphantly side by
side on Lookout's rocky crest. Prolonged huzzas
greeted the victors from below, and to confirm that 'to
the victors belong the spoils,' a detachment from two
regiments of Geary's command take charge of the prisoners,
seven stand of colors, and a great number of cannon
captured."</p>

<p>The rebels had burned the bridge across Lookout
creek, which delayed our further advance a short time.
A bridge was soon improvised, however, and a crossing
was effected. The command moved on to Rossville,
where it engaged Braggs' left, while General Thomas, advancing
from Chattanooga valley, moved up Missionary
ridge, striking Bragg a crushing blow in the center, and
Pap Sherman was making it warm for his right flank.
About 2 o'clock <span class="allsmcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span> the firing became general along the
entire line, which continued until late in the afternoon,
when the rebels were driven from the field with great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
loss. The Union army advanced a short distance and
bivouacked for the night.</p>

<p>November 26, we moved on after the retreating army,
and at a small creek near Greysville, Georgia, had a
skirmish, driving the enemy as far as Ringgold and Taylor's
ridge, where they were in position behind breastwork
in the narrow pass extending through the ridge in the
direction of Dalton.</p>

<p>27th. Geary's division made a gallant charge upon the
rebel works. The First brigade, commanded by Colonel
William R. Creighton, made a direct assault on Taylor's
ridge, while the Second and Third brigades engaged the
rebels in the narrow defile. After a terrible struggle the
Nationals were forced back a short distance. A battery
was moved forward and placed in position, which opened
with double shotted guns upon the enemy, soon driving
them precipitately to the rear, leaving the Nationals in
possession of the field. In this engagement the Union
loss was quite heavy.</p>

<p>On the 28th the army moved back, Geary's division
reaching Wauhatchie valley on the 29th. Resting a few
days, when the Twenty-ninth Ohio regiment broke camp
and on December 3d moved across Lookout creek,
marched about two miles west of Summerville, on Lookout
mountain, where it camped for the night. Returned
to its old camp at Wauhatchie, Tennessee, on the
5th day of December, and the campaign of 1863 ended.</p>

<p>At Wauhatchie, on the 10th day of December, 1863,
the Twenty-ninth Ohio, though now reduced to less
than three hundred effective men for duty, almost to a
man re-enlisted for three years more, should the war so
long continue, and were given a thirty-days' furlough
home for the purpose of recruiting. The headquarters
of the regiment was established at Cleveland, Ohio.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
It remained here some two months. At last the decimated
ranks were filled and, on the morning of February
8, 1864, the regiment bade a second good bye to friends,
and amidst their prayers for success and a safe return
departed for the front, determined to die for the flag if
necessary, and, after a tedious ride of many weary miles
arrived at Bridgeport, Alabama, via Louisville, Nashville,
and Murfreesboro, where it went into winter quarters and
remained until the opening of the spring campaign of
1864.</p>

</div>

<p class="center"><small>Shelmound&mdash;Wauhatchie Valley&mdash;Ringgold&mdash;Battle of Dug or Mill
Creek Gap or Buzzard's Roost&mdash;On the Move.</small></p>

<p>On the morning of May 3, 1864, at 10 o'clock, we
broke camp, crossed the Tennessee river, and moved
eastward along its south bank to Shelmound, where we
encamped for the night. On the following day the march
was resumed, the column halting for dinner in Wauhatchie
valley. Crossing Lookout Creek and mountain,
we encamped for the night on its east side and two miles
distant from Chattanooga. The column resumed its
line of march at 7 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span>, on the 5th. Moving cautiously
during the day, in the advance, it halted for the night a
short distance west of Ringgold, Georgia. At daybreak
on the following morning we moved forward, and about
9 o'clock formed line of battle, remaining here during
the day and subsequent night. The beat of the "long
roll" on the following morning called us to arms, and we
immediately advanced in line of battle. When near
Gordon's Springs General Kilpatrick passed to our right
with his command. Our column came to a halt for the
night near Tunnel hill.</p>

<p>At about 11 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span>, on May 8th, we pushed forward in
order of columns right in front, and at 3 o'clock arrived
in front of John's Mountain at Rocky Face Ridge, on
the summit of which the enemy were entrenched in force.
The Twenty-ninth Ohio regiment and Twenty-eighth
Pennsylvania of the First brigade, Colonel Candy commanding,
with three regiments of Buschbeck's Second
brigade, formed in line, the latter on the right, and in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
order at once moved forward to storm the ridge. The
position of the Twenty-ninth regiment in the assaulting
column was on the extreme left, the Twenty-eighth
Pennsylvania next on its right, connecting with the
Second brigade. Our instructions were to make a strong
demonstration, and to carry, if possible, the rebel position.
While advancing to the assault, the brass bands in
our rear indiscreetly commenced playing National airs,
which attracted the attention of the rebel commander,
who rapidly concentrated reinforcements in our front.
The advance up the declivity was nearly as difficult as
Lookout Mountain, and more completely fortified. Its
summit was steep, precipitous, and covered with scraggy
rocks and immense boulders. From our position we
commanded a fine view of Dug Gap, a narrow, artificial
cut through the rocky summit, connecting with a road
extending almost parallel with the ridge to the gap
beyond, and by a zigzag course reaching the mountain's
base. The rebels had so completely fortified themselves
that it was next to impossible for our assaulting force to
get nearer than their base. As we approached the rebel
line, a regiment was moved by left flank across our front.
At this moment the rebel line opened a fire so deadly in
effect that the regiment in our front became disordered
and broke through our ranks to the rear, causing a momentary
confusion in the ranks of the Twenty-ninth regiment.
At this moment the order was given to advance,
which was executed with a rush despite the deadly volleys
that were cutting through our ranks. Up! up! we go
to death or victory! and commenced to scale the obstructions
close to their works; and now a storm of deadly
missiles are hurled against us. Rocks, boulders, and
even cart-wheels come crashing down upon us. Yet we
moved steadily in the deadly advance until ordered back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
by our officers, when we retired a few paces to reform
our line, the fallen trees only separating us from the
enemy.</p>

<p>Here we made a determined and bloody fight, but
having no support to cover our flank we were subjected
to a deadly cross-fire from the left, yet the regiment stubbornly
stood its ground, returning shot for shot until its
ammunition was exhausted. More was secured from the
cartridge-boxes of the dead and wounded, and with this
we fought on, determined to hold the position until reinforcements
should reach us. Just before dusk an order
came from the commanding general for the Twenty-ninth
regiment to retire, all the other regiments having
done so some time previous. To cover our retreat a
line of skirmishers was thrown out, composed of men
from each company who volunteered for this dangerous
duty, and right nobly did they perform this work, firing
with deadly precision as they retired from the field into
the valley below, where the Twenty-ninth were already in
bivouac, and comrades cheered lustily as the skirmishers
came in, happy to know they had not met the fate of
others.</p>

<p>John Davis, of company B, a Scotchman by birth and
one of the best shots in the regiment, fired the last shot
in this day's action, and was the last to leave the field.</p>

<p>The Twenty-ninth regiment in this fight distinguished
itself by brave conduct, though at last compelled to
retire from lack of support. Our losses in killed and
wounded was more than double that of any other regiment
engaged: Killed, 26; wounded, 67; captured 1;
total 94.</p>

<p>General Geary highly complimented the regiment for
its gallantry, remarking that he never saw men advance
under such murderous fire, especially when unsupported<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
and where the chances of success were so desperate.
The Twenty-ninth regiment lost nearly one-third its
numbers during this three hours' engagement, and many
were the individual acts of heroism displayed, which it
would give the writer pleasure to record. As but few
are now remembered, the remainder would suffer an injustice
were these given. It is, however, but simple justice
to state that the regiment fully sustained its previous
reputation as a fighting organization, each individual
doing his full share in the terrible work. Subsequent
events proved that this assault was made to draw the
enemy to this point, thus giving McPherson's corps and
Kilpatrick's cavalry an opportunity to possess Snake
Creek Gap, a desirable situation several miles in our
right rear, opening a flank movement directly on the enemy's
rear.</p>

<p>On May 9th we encamp at Mill Creek, near Johns
Mountain, where we remain until 12 o'clock, midnight.
We then move to the right and throw up earthworks.
May 10th we are still at work. We receive the news of
General Grant's victory over General Lee at the Wilderness,
near Chancellorsville, Virginia, where our regiment
received such a baptism of blood a little more than a
year since. Alas! how many of our brave boys have
gone down to death since then.</p>

<p>May 11th. Still in the same position, hourly expecting
orders to move; quartermasters remove all extra baggage
to the rear; all men unable for active service sent to
hospital, and everything possible put into perfect fighting
order, and by the way it's ever so much nicer penning
these lines here in our cosy room in the far away Western
Reserve of the Buckeye State than was the actual experience
in Secessia during those early May days of
1864.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span></p>

<p>On the 12th instant we moved forward to Snake
Creek Gap, forming a junction with the Fifteenth and
Sixteenth corps (McPherson's), where we remained during
the night. At 2 o'clock <span class="allsmcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span> on the following day
we advanced toward Resaca, fully occupying Snake
Creek Gap. Our cavalry are sharply engaged with the
enemy. Here brave General Kilpatrick is wounded. At
4 o'clock <span class="allsmcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span> the battle is still raging fiercely, and the
enemy are being slowly driven back. At last a hill is
captured which covers the entire rebel line. Here we
fortify and rest for the night.</p>

<p>May 14th a severe engagement opens near Resaca;
we advance by a circuitous route to the left; the Fourteenth
corps is engaged; during the afternoon we
joined our Twentieth corps and moving rapidly to the
left; succeeded in rescuing a portion of the Fourth corps
from disaster and defeat, and one of its batteries from
certain capture, the infantry support having been driven
back, leaving the battery at the mercy of the rebels.
Robinson's brigade, of Williams' division, Twentieth
corps, who were in the advance, fortunately reached the
scene of action in time to prevent the capture of another
battery by making a counter-charge on the advancing
rebel legions. We came up soon after this support,
which soon ended in the complete repulse of the rebels,
driving them beyond their fortifications. The Twentieth
army corps received the compliments of the commanding
general, Hooker, for their gallant work, which resulted
in a loss to the enemy of some four hundred men
killed and wounded.</p>

<p class="center"><small>Battle of Resaca, Georgia&mdash;In Pursuit of the Fleeing Chivalry (?)</small></p>

<p>At an early hour on the morning of May 15th sharp
skirmishing opened along our entire front. General
Geary's Second division moved a short distance to the
left and halted for orders. About 11 o'clock Generals
Sherman, Hooker, and Thomas, with their respective
staffs, reached the battlefield and immediately held a
council of war. General Hooker is requested to assume
command of selected troops to take the offensive, and
is asked how large a force he required to capture a certain
fort directly in our front, known to be the enemy's
stronghold and the key to his position. Hooker astonished
his superiors by replying: "Geary's division can,
I think, carry that position if it can be done by anyone."
As this conversation was heard by our men we were prepared
for what was to follow.</p>

<p>As soon as General Geary had received his instructions,
the Second division moved to the attack in the
following orders: Second and Third brigades in the
advance, with the First brigade closely massed in their
rear, the latter advancing closely in support of the attacking
column. Our advance was met with obstinate resistance,
yet we steadily pushed forward, driving the enemy
back and gaining possession of three lines of hills in
rapid succession, the last of which was in close proximity
to the rebel fort, only a narrow ravine intervening. The
enemy are strongly entrenched in earthworks extending
in the rear of the fort. The First brigade commenced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
a rapid firing at short range to cover the sortie being
made by regiments of the Second and Third brigades.
These regiments rush gallantly forward to the assault.
They are repulsed but quickly reform, and, with other
regiments sent to their support, they again pass forward.
The fort was captured and lost three times in succession,
but at last the rebels are forced to flee before our furious
charge. Leaving the guns they join the main line.</p>

<p>The Union forces prevented the rebels from again
occupying the fort until dark, when detachments from
the Twenty-ninth and other Ohio regiments of the First
brigade were sent to open a trench through the earthworks
of the fort through which to move the guns into
the ravine below. The rebels discovering this charged
down upon us to recapture the guns. Expecting such
an attack the First brigade had moved forward into the
ravine, and now waited the coming of the rebels. When
close upon them a signal was given, which was followed
by a sheet of flame along our whole line, dealing terrible
destruction into the rebel ranks, immediately followed
by a determined bayonet charge, which threw their
lines into disorder and they fled panic-stricken over
their fortifications, closely pursued by our command,
whose loud huzzas sent Johnston's army in rapid retreat,
abandoned all its cannon, hospital, and commissary
stores, and with their usual savagery leaving their own
dead and wounded upon the field. We also captured
many prisoners.</p>

<p>This success was a grand victory for the "white star"
division of the Twentieth corps, yet not unattended with
losses, which were, however, light in comparison with
those of the enemy. In fact, in the night attack we
had so thoroughly surprised the enemy that but feeble
resistance was made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span></p>

<p>At an early hour on the morning of May 16th we
pushed rapidly forward in pursuit of the retreating rebels.
At 9 o'clock <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span> we came into line on the bank of the
Coosa river, near the railroad bridge, which our cavalry
had prevented the rebels from burning, though they had
made repeated efforts to do so. The enemy's flight was
so rapid that he had not even time to seriously impair
the railroad track. Our locomotives, with trains of supplies,
soon came in sight. We now advanced across the
river and encamped for the night.</p>

<p>At 12 <span class="allsmcap">M.</span> on May 17th, the general forward movement
of our army was resumed. The Twenty-ninth
regiment was the advance guard of its division, and
assisted in driving the rebels from the little village of
Calhoun, where we halt for the night. At 5 o'clock on
the following morning we again moved forward in the
direction of Rome, Georgia. At Rome cross-roads the
rebels were met and promptly engaged by the Fourth
corps; a lively fight ensued, resulting in slight losses on
both sides. The enemy retreated, and we continued the
pursuit until 9 o'clock <span class="allsmcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span>, when we encamped for the
night.</p>

<p>On the next morning at early dawn we pushed forward,
continuing until 3 o'clock <span class="allsmcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span>, when we halt and
form line near Kingston, Georgia. The whole force of
the enemy are immediately on our front, and the Fourth
corps promptly open fire upon them, which resulted in a
further movement of the chivalry to the rear.</p>

<p>We remain here until the morning of May 23d when
we move about daylight via Cassville and Cass station to
the Etowah river, which is crossed on pontoons, and a
halt for the night made on its opposite bank. The next
morning we resume the weary march, coming into
line of battle at about 9 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span> We advanced in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
order up the Raccoon hills, or Allatoona range, until
night, when we encamp at Burnt Hickory. The First
brigade, as advance guard, moved ahead at daybreak,
via the Burnt Hickory road.</p>

</div>

<p class="center"><small>Pumpkin Vine Creek&mdash;Dallas, or New Hope Church&mdash;Slight Unpleasantness&mdash;Personal.</small></p>

<p>At Pumpkin Vine creek we discover the enemy and
drive back his skirmishers, who are stationed on its opposite
bank, recovering the bridge, which we cross and
throw out skirmishers on the opposite side. While this
was being accomplished, General Hooker and Staff, with
a small body guard, pushed ahead to reconnoiter. He
had not advanced far, however, when he was attacked by
a force of rebel sharp shooters. He now came tearing
back into our lines shouting to General Geary to move
his First brigade into position to hold the enemy in
check until the Second and Third brigades should come
up, they being some four miles in our rear. We quickly
formed line by columns to the right and left, the Twenty-ninth
Ohio occupying position on the extreme left,
Knapp's battery taking position immediately in our rear,
to cover the bridge in case we were forced to retire before
reinforcements should reach us. As the left company
of the Twenty-ninth were completing the battle-line
a rebel column was found marching in close
proximity to our flank.</p>

<p>Ten paces to the front the skirmishers were hotly engaged,
but our flank was uncovered. We immediately
face to the left and prepare to fire, but are prevented by
instructions not to draw on a general engagement but to
hold the position at all hazards. The rebel column on
our flank, however, slowly retired without firing a gun,
and forming on their main line, which was massed in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
woods a short distance to our front. During this time
we hastily changed front in form of a semi-circle to protect
us from flank attack. This movement was executed
none too soon, as the enemy came immediately to the
attack, and a sharp engagement opened all along the
line, which was a hot one, yet it gallantly held its own
until the balance of its division came up. Forming in
column with us, we advance on the rebel line and drive
them slowly back.</p>

<p>The battle now became fierce and our assaults were
heroically met. Generals Hooker and Geary were present
and ordered the attack, the plan of which was to advance
lines and fire, to be followed by bayonet charges, by
which the enemy was steadily driven back. Our front
line was frequently relieved by columns from the rear,
thus keeping fresh men at the front. Geary's division
alone had driven Hood's rebel corps back to the forks of
the road at New Hope church, when Butterfield's Third
division arrived and took position on our left. Soon
after, Williams came up with the First division and
passed to the front, which allowed the Second division
to drop in the reserve long enough to clean our firearms
and replenish cartridge-boxes, when we again advance in
support of the First and Third divisions.</p>

<p>Just as the sun disappeared in the western horizon,
General Geary ordered the First brigade to charge the
enemy. This movement was executed on the double-quick,
and as our columns passed in perfect alignment
to the front, Butterfield's and Williams' commands
greeted us with hearty cheers of genuine admiration.
Onward the column rushes, and closing with the enemy
delivers a terrible volley. The charge is continued, the
air resounding with defiant cheers as the enemy is driven
from the field and down a hill at a brisk run. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
now beginning to grow dark, and the impetuous rush of
the men soon brought them within a short distance of a
line of brush-covered work which concealed the enemy's
batteries, who at once opened a terrific and deadly fire of
grape and canister into our ranks. Instantly falling on
the ground, we deliver so destructive a fire on their
cannoniers that their guns are soon silenced. Our left
being without support, an attempt to carry their works
was extremely hazardous. The regiment on our right
had already retired some distance to our right rear, making
the situation of the Twenty-ninth regiment one of
great danger, but owing to the darkness we knew nothing
of it until an officer of Geary's staff came forward with
an order to fall back, when we retired to a position some
forty paces from the rebel line.</p>

<p>The enemy had now ceased firing, and perfect silence
reigned, only broken by the groans of the wounded and
dying. The Twenty-ninth regiment had suffered severe
loss, and only the favorable depression in its front saved
it from annihilation. W. F. Stevens, captain of company
B, was wounded in this action.</p>

<p>The Fifth Ohio, on our right on higher ground, suffered
fearfully from the masked batteries, one company being
almost entirely decimated. This caused the regiment to
retire to the knoll. Colonel Patrick, a most gallant
officer of the Fifth, was killed, also seventy-five of his
men killed and wounded. The loss of the Twenty-ninth
Ohio in this charge was forty killed and wounded, shot
down in almost the short space of time required to
record it.</p>

<p>It was not long before we heard tremendous cheering
in the distance on our right front, which was caused by
Sherman moving a force in that direction, turning the
rebel flank, which was soon in full retreat. Immediately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
after, sounds were heard in the supposed deserted rebel
works, which we believed were our own men who had
recently occupied them, and by reason of this supposed
safety our whole command was soon in slumber deep
and heavy from exhaustion of the day's labor.</p>

<p>At early dawn on May 26th the enemy discovered our
close proximity, and at once opened upon us with artillery,
and at about the same time advanced its infantry
to attack us in our rear. This movement was discovered,
however, in time to prevent its further progress.
After a hot fight the enemy retired to his fortifications.
During the day several attempts were made in the same
direction, but without effect. Near the close of the day
we were temporarily relieved and retired to a ravine a
few yards in our rear, where we received rations, the first
"square meal" in two days.</p>

<p>At an early hour the following morning (May 27th)
our artillery took position at the breastworks and opened
a furious cannonading, which is replied to with spirit by
the rebel batteries. During the afternoon the enemy
made a sortie on our line, a general engagement ensued,
and the rebels were beaten back. The Twenty-ninth
regiment loss was slight, we being well protected by rifle
pits. The rebel loss in this attack was severe, their dead
and wounded being thickly strewn in front of our works.
During this attack General Sherman and staff took position
in our rear. General Hooker is generally where the
bullets fly thickest, and his utter disregard of danger has
won the love of the "boys," who call him "Uncle Joe,"
and who are all, at any time, ready to go through fire if
he so desires, knowing he will not ask them to go where
he fears to lead.</p>

<p>The battle continues throughout the following day,
with brisk infantry firing and heavy cannonading almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
incessantly. As night again shrouds the bloody field the
Twenty-ninth regiment, with the exception of company
B, which was on the skirmish line, relieved the Seventh
Ohio, One Hundred and Ninth, and One Hundred and
Forty-seventh Pennsylvania. The rebels were unusually
quiet during the night. Company B remained on the
skirmish nearly all of the following day and was kept
hotly engaged. The company's position was not more
than eight rods from the rebel outposts, who made it extremely
hot for us as we went back and forth to the relief
of our comrades, and sometimes unsoldierly attitudes
were assumed to evade their deadly aim. Late in the
day company B was relieved. Henry Brainard, Spencer
Atkin, and Henry Clark volunteered to go out and bring
in the bodies of Albert Atkin, C. A. Davis, and Jerome
Phinney, which they did, the enemy opening fire upon
them with musketry and artillery, the deadly missiles flying
thick and fast about them. Such was the treatment
of the "chivalry" to men bravely exposing themselves
to give Christian interment to the gallant men who had
fought their last battle. However, none were injured.
While performing the last sad rites of burial, the rebels
came out in a sortie and made furious assaults along our
entire line. Our men reserved their fire until the enemy
were close upon them, when, at a given signal, some
twenty cannon, double shotted with grape, opened fire,
which made the earth tremble with their awful thunder,
while the infantry sent deadly volleys into their ranks.
The result of this fire was most terrible slaughter to the
enemy, who broke and ran anywhere to cover, leaving
several hundred dead and dying behind, the ground
between the two lines being literally covered with the
rebel dead. During the 30th there were several sharp
fights, our regiment having several men wounded. May<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
31st the regiment was under fire, as usual, the greater
part of the day, and at night was engaged in the construction
of an advanced line of works, under a heavy
fire from the entire rebel line. Before they were fully
completed the rebels commenced an attack and we fell
back on the main line. General Geary being present,
exclaimed, "Get back to your command in readiness for
an engagement." One ensued, which resulted in driving
the enemy back with severe loss to them. We now
resumed work and finally succeeded in completing the
line, though continually annoyed by the enemy's firing.</p>

<p>On the morning of June 1st the regiment resumed its
place on the front line and was soon furiously engaged,
which continued during the fore part of the day. At
noon the Twentieth corps was relieved by Logan's Fifteenth
corps and moved to the left as support to the
Fourth corps (General Howard). The following morning
we moved towards the left and at 11 o'clock <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span>
formed line and pushed forward in concert with Schofield's
Twenty-third corps. We capture two lines of
rebel works, the enemy falling back. That night we
slept on our arms. At dawn on the 3d we advanced
and were soon engaged with the enemy, the skirmishing
along our whole line being very strong. During the day
Sherman succeeded in turning the rebel right, causing
him to retire with severe loss. Twenty-ninth loss:
Killed, six; wounded, twenty-four; captured, one; total
thirty-one. This is the tenth day we have been under
fire. 4th.&mdash;Firing during all of last night. All quiet
to-day.</p>

<p class="center"><small>Advance to Pine Knob&mdash;Battle at that Place&mdash;A Forward Movement.</small></p>

<p>At 5 o'clock on the morning of June 6th, the army
pushed forward after the retreating enemy. When about
two miles from Ackworth Station he makes a stand, and
we wheel into line, the Twenty-ninth acting as skirmishers
while the other troops were engaged in preparing
rifle-pits. The Fourteenth corps now came up, forming
on our left, and General Howard's Fourth corps on our
right. The position remained the same until June 10th,
when the Twenty-ninth Ohio is sent forward on a reconnoissance.
A large force of rebels are found to be
strongly entrenched on Pine mountain. At dark the
regiment returned to the main line, where the situation
remains unchanged until June 14th, when our entire
force move forward. The Twentieth, with the Fourth
corps on its left, take position immediately in front of
the rebel army, on Pine mountain. At evening the
Twenty-ninth was again advanced to the skirmish line,
and was engaged, as was our artillery, throughout the
greater part of the night. On the following day, June
15th, occurs the battle of Pine Knob, Georgia.</p>

<p>At early dawn our regiment pushed forward as the
advance of a general flank movement on Pine mountain,
which resulted in its capture without severe fighting.
The Twentieth corps was changed from the front to the
right. Moving rapidly in that direction it soon reached
another strongly entrenched position of the enemy,
when the column made a left half wheel, which brought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
the first brigade of Geary's division directly in front of
Pine Knob.</p>

<p>This position of the enemy was found to be strongly
fortified. Twenty embrazures, from which as many cannon
bristled, covered all the approaches to it. General
Hooker ordered General Geary to send two regiments in
a sortie against the rebel position, and the Twenty-ninth
Ohio and Twenty-eighth Pennsylvania regiments, the
latter on our left, were at once forwarded to the assault.
General Hooker, mounted on his famous gray charger,
advanced with us, immediately in rear of our line. The
general's presence greatly encouraged the men in this
desperate undertaking.</p>

<p>On the hill were the twenty cannon, which we knew
would soon belch forth destruction to our ranks. The
two regiments silently but rapidly cross a ravine where
they encounter two rebel regiments. These proved to
be the First and Twenty-ninth Georgia. We opened
fire briskly and charging upon them soon drove them in
disorder to the rear.</p>

<p>We pursued them so hotly that our standard-bearer
was at one time within a few paces of the rebel Twenty-ninth
Georgia colors, which we were making desperate
efforts to capture. The rebel color-bearer was shot,
but their flag was grasped again by another rebel who
escaped with it into their fortification. But the regiment
to which he belonged was nearly annihilated before it
succeeded in regaining its main line. Our regiment had
rushed upon them forcing them back step by step until
they were under cover, and we had succeeded in killing,
wounding, and taking prisoners all except the little handful
who escaped with the flag. At the moment of their
escape we made a dash to carry their fortifications, but
were checked by abattis and a deep trench hidden by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
brush. At this point their artillery opened with murderous
discharges of grape and canister, which produced
terrible destruction in our ranks. Still the line stands
firm. Another instant and our men are laying flat upon
the ground and the deadly missiles go hissing harmlessly
through the air over our heads. We now open a fire
upon their cannoniers, so deadly in its character that the
guns are soon silenced.</p>

<p>Night was fast coming on when our line was ordered
to fall back to a more secure position. The men now
engage in the erection of earthworks within a few rods of
the rebel fort on the knob, which placed the Twenty-ninth
Ohio in the extreme front, our flanking regiments
assuming a circular position on our right and left rear.
We were under fire all night, the rebel infantry and artillery
keeping up an almost continuous rattle in their
endeavors to drive our men from their labors on the fortifications.
Despite this, however, we held our position,
though suffering a constant loss in our ranks.</p>

<p>Just at daybreak on the 16th instant the Sixty-sixth
Ohio, of our brigade from the reserve, relieved us; we,
however, left them well protected by the strong earthworks
constructed during the night.</p>

<p>The Twenty-ninth Ohio regiment went into this
action with two hundred members, of whom thirty-nine
were killed and wounded. Among the killed was First
Sergeant Joel E. Tanner, one of our bravest men. Soon
after his death his commission reached us promoting
him to a captaincy for bravery in action. God help that
little wife of his in her far away northern home to bear
his death bravely as the wife of a soldier should, even
though all her hopes and bright anticipations seem shattered
by the blow. Generals Joe Hooker and Geary
announced in warm terms their admiration of the "gallant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
manner in which the Twenty-ninth Ohio and Twenty-eighth
Pennsylvania regiments conducted themselves in
the assault on Pine Knob." The former remarked that
taking into consideration the deadly fire we were exposed
to, we had accomplished that which he never saw so
small a force attempt before. As he was present in the
assault his opinion is of value.</p>

<p>Sharp skirmishing and artillery firing continued along
the line during the day. At night the Twenty-ninth
regiment moved to the front, relieving the Sixty-sixth
Ohio regiment. It was nearly morning when we discovered
that the enemy were withdrawing their artillery.
We at once advanced and possessed the rebel fortifications
on the hill with little trouble, as the artillery had
already withdrawn and the infantry were rapidly following.
After daylight we pushed forward, only to find the
enemy in another strong position, which we at once attacked.
A rambling fire was kept up during the entire
day.</p>

<p>During the following day (June 18th) the same state
of affairs continued, the firing extending along our entire
front. At an early hour next morning the enemy retreated,
and we moved in pursuit, the Twenty-ninth
Ohio regiment, as usual, in the advance as skirmishers.
Why, I believe the "boys" would have rebelled had they
not been put on the skirmish line whenever there was a
prospect of somebody being killed on our side. Rapidly
we gained possession of two lines of hills, and soon
found the enemy upon a third ridge, strongly fortified.
A skirmish of two hours' duration ensues, and we are
ordered to fall back to the main line, as support to
Bundy's Thirteenth New York battery.</p>

<p>June 20th the Twenty-ninth regiment and its brigade
are in line three miles southwest of Marietta, Georgia,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
and skirmished all day with the enemy. As night came
on our division moved to the right, forming on the right
of Butterfield's Third division. Our regiment was again
on the skirmish line, and in active engagement during
the greater part of the night. The next morning we
formed line of battle near Culp's farm and to the right
of Little Kenesaw mountain. At about 11 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span> our
regiment was withdrawn from the skirmish line, and at
once began throwing up rifle-pits parallel with works of
Williams' First division on our right and Butterfield's on
our left. The Third brigade of the Second division now
advanced and engaged the enemy, our single line affording
feeble protection in the event of an attack on our
position.</p>

</div>

<p class="center"><small>Battle of Culp's Farm or Kenesaw Mountain&mdash;The Glorious Fourth&mdash;Advance
to the Chattahoochie.</small></p>

<p>June 22d we move to the front, and occupy a ridge on
Culp's farm, which covers the level on our front. We
had been but a short time in this position when the
rebel General Hood's corps was moved directly on our
front, and immediately advanced in furious attack upon
the divisions of Generals Geary and Williams. Our
artillery was at once turned upon the advancing rebel
columns, which, with the terrific volleys our infantry
poured into their ranks, produced a sudden check to their
further advance, and in less than one hour these two
divisions succeeded in beating back and putting to total
rout Hood's entire command, which suffered great loss,
while ours was but slight. The enemy left on the field
2,100 killed, wounded, and prisoners, besides many
wounded, removed from the field. The estimated rebel
loss was 3,000 men. Eight hundred of the rebel dead
were buried on the field.</p>

<p>At the close of this action a body of our skirmishers
were deployed over the field, finding the enemy's dead
and wounded scattered thickly about. In places they
lay stretched across each other, literally heaped up,
bloody, terrible&mdash;dead. Our skirmishers advanced rapidly,
and were soon engaged with the enemy's rear, but
this soon ceased, and we established a picket line for the
night. We remained on the field until noon of the 23d,
when we were retired and rejoined the main line.</p>

<p>At about 4 o'clock <span class="allsmcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span>, one hundred guns opened a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
simultaneous fire on Little Kenesaw mountain. Directly
in front of our regiment and across the creek, which flows
along the base of the mountain, is level ground. At
this point is situated a block-house and rifle-pits, the
latter between the house and mountain, and both now
held by rebel sharpshooters, who were continually picking
off our cannoniers. General Geary, evidently contemplating
an advance of his line, called for twenty
volunteers from the Twenty-ninth regiment to dislodge
these troublesome occupants of the block-house and
rifle-pits. In response to this call two men from each
company came quickly forward, and at once advanced
across the creek and ravine. The rebels soon discovered
the detachment; and opened fire upon it. Sergeant
Griswold, of Company B, in command, rapidly advanced
his men up the rise of open ground lying between him
and the enemy, and with a rush amidst a perfect storm
of bullets, closed on the rifle-pits, capturing all who
remained in them.</p>

<p>We now approach the rear of the block-house and
demand its surrender. The rebel lieutenant in command
exclaimed from the window of the house: "You
d&mdash;d yanks, take us if you can!" and immediately
opened fire. The door of the house is soon battered
down, and the rebels attempt to cut their way out.
Finding themselves covered by nearly a score of rifles,
aimed by determined men, all, with the exception of the
rebel lieutenant and one other, threw down their arms
and surrendered. The rebel officer fired on the captors
and lost his life by his rashness. We had now a total of
twenty-one prisoners. Several others were killed or
badly wounded. The former were sent at once to the
rear, and the little force deployed along the road to hold
the position until reinforcements should arrive. However,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
they were not furnished, and after holding the position
some two hours a heavy body of rebels came
upon us, stealing along under cover of the bushes on
the opposite side of the road, suddenly arose and fired
a volley at us. The speed we made across the level
field with the rebels in hot pursuit, their bullets whistling
past our ears in the most energetic manner, would have
dismayed a professional pedestrian.</p>

<p>June 24th, skirmishing during the day. As night
came on a detachment of the Twenty-ninth regiment
was sent out on picket. Nothing occurred during the
night, and at dawn we returned to our brigade, where
orders were received to hold ourselves in readiness to
move on notice, cannonading and skirmish fighting being
kept up along the line.</p>

<p>The situation remained unchanged until June 27th.
At an early hour this morning two men from each company
of our regiment volunteered to advance to the relief
of the Pennsylvania regiment on the outposts, and
about 9 o'clock <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span> we moved forward. We were also
to dislodge the rebel sharpshooters, who had been allowed
to again possess the block-house and rifle-pits. Crossing
the creek and ravine we made a quick dash toward the
locality mentioned, amid a hot cross-fire from rebels
along the fence before referred to. But as we close the
rebels abandon the block-house and rifle-pits, yet dispute
with the energy of desperation, every inch of our advance
as they retire. We, however, gained possession
of the road beyond the house, an important position
covering the rebel left on Little Kenesaw.</p>

<p>They now opened fire on us from the mountain on
our left and front. Making a flank movement to the
left we came up in rear of some rebel rifle-pits, capturing
eleven prisoners and holding the position until the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
Fifth Ohio regiment came to our support. That regiment
at once began to fortify, while we remained on the
skirmish line under constant fire. The enemy discovered
the work of the Fifth and trained their batteries
from different directions on our position, and also advanced
infantry, who made repeated attempts to dislodge
us. Solid shot and shell came crashing through
the block-house, the shells bursting amongst us in quick
succession. Nor were their musketry behind in sending
their death-dealing missiles upon us.</p>

<p>Knapp's battery soon came up the hill, and swinging
into position, unlimbered and opened a rapid cross-fire
on Little Kenesaw mountain. About this time the
Fourteenth, with a portion of the Fourth corps, made a
desperate assault on the mountain a short distance to our
left. The engagement now became serious, one shell
killing twelve and another six of our men. To hold the
position we had captured was an arduous undertaking,
and so severe was the fighting that those of us who had
advanced early in the morning had fired nearly two hundred
rounds. At dusk the fighting ceased, and we are
recalled to our command.</p>

<p>June 28th.&mdash;This morning at sunrise we advance
obliquely to the right, and, reaching an advanced position,
throw up fortifications; rebel batteries open fire on us
meanwhile. Our lookout, as he sees smoke issue from
the rebel guns, calls out: "Lay down," "lay low," or
"look out, she's coming," etc. Many laughable and other
incidents occurred during this bombardment, such as attempts
to dodge shells, etc. Charles Upton, of Company
G, while carrying a rail, had it cut in two by a shell; he,
however, escaped unhurt.</p>

<p>June 29th.&mdash;To-day the Fourteenth corps obtained a
temporary truce under flag, during which they interred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
their dead. An assault is made on this corps during the
early part of the night, but is repulsed, and we were not
again disturbed.</p>

<p>June 30th.&mdash;During this afternoon the Twenty-ninth
regiment received orders to move. About 10 o'clock at
night our corps (the Twentieth) was relieved by the
Fourteenth. We at once marched several miles to the
right in relief of the Twenty-third corps.</p>

<p>On July 1st our regiment was again engaged. The
fighting ceased only with daylight. Sharp skirmishing
and severe cannonading continued during the entire day
of the 2d, and at night the Twenty-ninth regiment occupied
its customary position&mdash;on the skirmish line. This
time, however, it was accompanied by the Twenty-eighth
Pennsylvania. Just before daylight on the morning of
July 3d, the enemy were found to be retreating, and we
at once moved forward to find the works deserted, the
troops having evacuated. The position, as supposed,
was almost impregnable to direct assault, being constructed
to enfilade an attack of infantry.</p>

<p>The army now push forward in pursuit of the retreating
rebels, the Twenty-ninth Ohio and Twenty-eighth
Pennsylvania taking the advance in the order of heavy
skirmishers. We soon came upon Wheeler's rebel
cavalry, and engaged his dismounted men so promptly
that they fell precipitately back to where their horses
were picketed. The Twenty-ninth succeeded in capturing
nearly one hundred of them in their hurried efforts
to remount. The Second division during the pursuit
captured nearly nine hundred prisoners. The rebels were
steadily falling back on the Chattahoochie river. It was
late when we halted for the night. How sweet the wooing
of the drowsy god after such long continued fatigue,
only those who have been there can imagine, the soft side<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
of a rail on such occasions being more luxurious than
any patent spring contrivance of to-day.</p>

<p>July 4th. On this day, made glorious to all this goodly
land by the forefathers of both the blue and gray, was
celebrated by the issue of full rations of hard-tack,
s&mdash;&mdash;, bacon, and coffee, and wonderful feats of gormandizing
ensued. To make the day something of a
reminder of the Northern anniversary, with its tearing
headache of the 5th, General "Joe" ordered an issue
of liquor to the men, the first of the campaign. About
4 o'clock <span class="allsmcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span> we broke camp and marched towards the
left, but soon came to a halt for the night.</p>

<p>At dawn on the following day we pushed forward and
took possession of a line of works the rebels had only
evacuated on our approach. They are now crossing
Chattahoochie river. The advance is continued until
within about one and one-half miles of the river, where
we encounter a second line of rebel works, occupied by
the enemy to cover the retreat across the river.</p>

<p>July 6th we occupy the position of yesterday. During
the forenoon our regiment was support of Bundy's
New York battery, engaged in shelling the rebels from a
fort. About 2 <span class="allsmcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span> we returned with the battery to the
main line, and one hour later moved with our division to
the left and formed line of battle, in which position we
passed the night. On the day following we marched to
the left and assumed position in line between the Fourteenth
and Fifteenth corps. Sharp skirmishing was kept
up nearly all night. This position is maintained by our
regiment, with daily skirmishing, until the early dawn of
July 10th, when the Twenty-ninth Ohio is pushed forward
on a reconnoissance. We discover that the enemy
have retreated across the Chattahoochie. On reaching
the river we deploy as skirmishers along the north bank,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
the enemy being posted along the opposite side. Atlanta
lies only nine miles to the south of us. The rebel
army of General Joe E. Johnston is said to be strongly
intrenched some four miles south of our position. A
small number only of rebels remain on the opposite bank
of the Chattahoochie. The Union and rebel pickets
are on good terms, often meeting in the middle of the
river, where they exchange coffee for tobacco, which, by
the way, was a very scarce article with us. The Twenty-ninth
Ohio regiment now musters only one hundred and
fifty men for duty. The mustering officer tells us that
we have lost more men killed and wounded in proportion
to the number present at the beginning of this campaign
than any regiment in the Western army.</p>

<p>July 6, we were in support of a battery during the
forenoon. During the afternoon we moved to the left,
camping in a beautiful grove of pines.</p>

<p>7th. Moved forward some three miles, to a ridge
commanding a fine view of the country.</p>

<p>11th. The rebels have crossed Chattahoochie river.
Our pickets are posted on its north bank.</p>

<p>17th. Moved forward to the left, crossed the Chattahoochie
river at Peace ferry about 9 o'clock <span class="allsmcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span></p>

<p>18th. Moved forward some two miles, skirmishing
much of the distance.</p>

<p>19th. Advanced to Peach Tree creek, which we
crossed, encountering the enemy and taking some
prisoners.</p>

</div>

<p class="center"><small>Battle of Peach Tree Creek&mdash;Some of the "boys" go to Andersonville.</small></p>

<p>On the morning of July 20th, just as old Sol was tinting
the east with his rosy hue, our army began a general
forward movement, the Twentieth corps in this advance
being on the right centre, the Fourth corps left, resting
on our right, and Newton's division (Fourth corps) connecting
with our left. Slight skirmishing ensued early
in the morning, but towards noon the enemy retired.
The unbroken stillness which followed caused us to advance
cautiously lest the rebels draw us into an ambush.
On reaching Peach Tree creek, a narrow, sluggish stream,
whose abrupt banks, covered with briars and a dense,
almost impassable undergrowth, would be a fatal barrier
to a routed army, especially as the stream was without
bridges, the entire command came to a halt until crossings
could be constructed. Previous to the crossing of
the main line General Geary ordered forward a force in
reconnoissance, consisting of the Twenty-ninth Ohio,
Twenty-eighth Pennsylvania, a detachment of the
Thirty-third New Jersey, and four pieces of Bundy's
New York battery, Geary himself following and directing
the movement. When once across we advanced
over several rough sparsely wooded ravines until reaching
an eminence overlooking a narrow, open valley
on our front and left. Immediately on our right
front was a piece of heavy timber, extending also on
our rear. The ridge directly in our front was covered
with a thick undergrowth, affording a fine position for an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
ambuscade. Our force was now brought to a halt.
Bundy's battery was hastily put into position on the ridge
to cover the valley. The Twenty-ninth Ohio assumed
position on the right, and the Twenty-eighth Pennsylvania
on the left of the battery. D. E. Hurlburt, captain of
company K, had charge of a detail from the Twenty-ninth
and Sixty-sixth Ohio regiments in the skirmish of
the timber, so he states.</p>

<p>The detachment of the Thirty-third New Jersey
deployed as skirmishers across the valley in our front,
General Geary and staff following closely in its rear.
While they were advancing, we hastily constructed a
light barricade of fence rails, and Bundy prepared his
battery for business. We anxiously watched General
Geary and the skirmishers as they cautiously moved up
the ridge.</p>

<p>When within a few yards of the underbrush a large
force of rebels came from cover, and with wild yells
rushed forward. Captain Bundy at once opened fire
upon them, which threw them into disorder, but did not
check their advance. As Geary and staff passed over our
line his chief, Captain Elliott, fell from his horse, shot
dead. Geary shouted to us, "A general engagement! a
general engagement! My brave men hold to your position.
I will send support to you." He was answered
with rousing cheers. When the little remnant of the
skirmishing force had come in we commenced a rapid
fire in connection with Captain Bundy's double-shotted
guns, which speedily thinned the advancing columns of
rebels, but without avail, as the breaks were at once filled
with fresh troops. As the rebels attempted to close with
us our men seemed to be endowed with the valor born
of desperation, and clubbed them back. Forward they
came, a dense mass of living fire, and bravely we sustained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
the shock of twenty times our number. The
sharp rattle of musketry, the loud roar of Bundy's guns,
and the defiant shouts of the combatants, in close hand
to hand conflict, can never be erased from the tablets of
memory while life shall last. It was grandly, awfully
terrible.</p>

<p>A dense smoke settled around the battery and enclosing
the extreme left of the regiment, hid the position of
our right. Suddenly firing begins on us from our rear.
The cannoniers are disabled and the infantry are called
upon to work the guns, which were instantly turned to
the rear upon heavy masses of rebels advancing from
the woods on our flank. The greater part of our regiment
had discovered this movement in time to change
front to rear, but were instantly forced back by the overwhelming
numbers of the rebels, and those in charge of
the battery were instantly surrounded by a powerful mob
of yelling fiends. Still the double-shotted guns continue
to belch forth fire and death, cutting great gaps in the
ranks of the enemy at each discharge.</p>

<p>At the guns' front, with muskets clubbed, a hand to
hand conflict was had, to allow the reloading of the guns.
The situation was now most desperate. A cordon of
the enemy hemmed in the brave band, now reduced to
but seventy men, whose ammunition was exhausted, and
at last they were forced to surrender the battery. Henry
Rood, of company A, and Henry E. Clark, company B,
are the only names the writer has been able to secure of
those captured at this time.</p>

<p>General Geary came up soon after, charged the enemy
and recovered the battery, which was instantly turned
upon the rebels, causing great destruction. The prisoners
were, however, too far in the rear for recapture, and
they were conveyed to that loathsome earthly hell, Andersonville.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
What they endured, the cruelties of the studied
starvation by express order of chivalric Jeff Davis, and
the horrible atrocities accorded to defenseless prisoners
by the Southern opponents in this unholy, ungodly conflict,
the writer will not attempt to describe; language
fails in the recital. Loss: Killed, two; wounded, seven;
captured, five; total fourteen.</p>

<p class="center"><small>Siege of Atlanta&mdash;The Capitulation&mdash;General Sherman's Report.</small></p>

<p>July 21st, heavy skirmishing on our right. 22d, we
moved forward in pursuit of the retreating rebels. 23d,
we are now strongly intrenched, within two miles of
Atlanta, Georgia; lively skirmishing much of the time.
24th, shelling and picket firing to-day; rebels charged
our line but were repulsed. 25th, brisk firing all day.
26th, advanced our line forty rods. 27th, quiet along
the lines. 28th, heavy firing on our right; the rebels
are repulsed. 29th and 30th, fighting continues.</p>

<p>August 1st to 3d, hot firing all the time. 4th, National
Thanksgiving Day; fighting on our right; rebels
driven back; skirmishing every day&mdash;all the time; getting
monotonous. 25th, left our works and fell back to the
Chattahoochie river, near Vining station; marched all
night. 27th, Major-general W. H. Slocum assumed
command of the Twentieth army corps.</p>

<p>September 4th, moved forward to Atlanta, which we
reached about 2 o'clock <span class="allsmcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span>; marched through the
city and went into camp about one and one-half miles
west of the city. 6th, received an order from General
Sherman that the campaign was ended, and that the
troops are to have a full month's rest; that our task was
not only done, but well done. 12th, the citizens of Atlanta
were moved south to-day; from this date we lay
in camp with little to mar our happiness till November
1st, when we received orders to send all our baggage to
the rear and put ourselves in light marching order.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
November 5th, orders having been received for the
troops to move, the Twenty-ninth struck tents and
marched from Atlanta at 3:30 <span class="allsmcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span> in the direction of
Stone Mountain, some three miles, and camped for the
night. At 1 o'clock <span class="allsmcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span> on the following day, the regiment
marched back to Atlanta, and again occupied its
old camp.</p>

<p>During the afternoon of the 1st of September specific
orders for the withdrawal of Stewart's rebel <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">corps de
armee</i> and the militia were issued, and about sunset the
latter were withdrawn from the trenches. When they
were fairly on the road Stewart's corps followed, all being
en route by midnight, except the cavalry, a brigade or
two of infantry, and the pickets. These latter remained
until the advance of the Twentieth corps neared the city
on the morning of the 2d. The explosion of ammunition
was of course heard at the position of the Twentieth
corps, and though General Slocum (who it appears was
in command of the Twentieth corps at the time) had received
no intelligence of Sherman's great success at
Jonesboro, he was not unprepared to find Hood gone
any morning, and the explosions convinced him that the
withdrawal was taking place. He instantly issued orders
to his division commanders, Generals Ward, Williams,
and Geary, to send out each a heavy reconnoissance at
daybreak on the morning of the 2d.</p>

<p>About 1,000 men were detailed from each division,
and at 5 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span> pushed forward on neighboring roads into
Atlanta on the north and northwest, encountering no opposition.
They pushed rapidly forward, and at 8 o'clock
came in sight of the rebel intrenchments, so lately occupied
with enemies but now silent and deserted.</p>

<p>Advancing rapidly, Colonel Coburn, commanding
General Ward's reconnoissance, entered the enemy's<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
works, encountering in the suburbs Mayor Calhoun, of
Atlanta, and a deputation of the city council. The former
nervously presented a paper surrendering the city
and asking protection. Colonel Coburn refused to receive
the paper for informality, and directed that another
should be drawn up. Mayor Calhoun invited several of
General Ward's staff to accompany him to the court-house,
where the documents should be made <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en regle</i>,
promising at the same time to expel the drunken rebel
stragglers, who were lingering in the streets and were disposed
to skirmish with our advance. He immediately
took measures to effect the last, and accompanied by the
officers whose names are offered in attest, he returned to
the court-house, and the following document was drawn
up:</p>

</div>

<p>The preliminary formalities thus disposed of, our
troops entered the city with music and flags, marching
promptly and erect. A fine flag-staff was found on the
Franklin printing house, where the Memphis Appeal had
been printed. The stars and stripes were soon flung to
the calm, sunny air amid the cheers of the brave men
who had fought for so many weary, consuming days to
place it there.</p>

<p>General Henry W. Slocum established his headquarters
at the Trout house, the leading hotel of the city,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
overlooking the public square. In the forts around Atlanta
eleven heavy guns, mainly sixty-four pounders, were
left by the enemy; also about three thousand muskets, in
good order, stored in various parts of the city, were
found; also three locomotives in running order, and
large quantities of manufactured tobacco were discovered.
Between one and two hundred stragglers, the
majority of them very drunk, were fished from their hiding
places and placed under guard at the court-house.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Army Headquarters</span>, July 26, 1864.
</p>

<p>"The major-general commanding the army congratulates
the troops upon the brilliant success attending the
Union arms in the late battles. In the battle of the
20th instant, in which the Twentieth corps, one division
of the Fourth corps, and part of the Fourteenth corps
were engaged, the total union loss in killed, wounded,
and missing was 1,733. In front of the Twentieth corps
there were put out of the fight 6,000 rebels; 563 of the
enemy were buried by our own troops, and the rebels
were permitted to bury 250. The Second division of
the Fourth corps repulsed seven different assaults of the
enemy with light loss to themselves, and which must
have swelled the number of dead buried by the rebels to
beyond 300. We also captured seven stands of colors.
No official report has been received of the part taken in
the battle by the Fourteenth corps. In the battle of the
22d instant, the total Union loss in killed, wounded, and
missing was 3,500, and also 10 pieces of artillery. The
rebel loss in prisoners captured was 3,200. The known
dead of the enemy in front of the Fifteenth and Sixteenth
corps and one division of the Seventeenth corps
was 2,142. The other divisions of the Seventeenth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
corps repulsed six assaults of the enemy before they fell
back, and which will swell the rebel loss in killed to at
least 3,000. The latest reports state that we buried over
3,200 rebels killed in this fight. There were captured
from the enemy in this battle 18 stands of colors and
5,000 stands of arms.</p>

<p>"The officers and soldiers of the armies of the Cumberland,
Ohio, and Tennessee have already received the
thanks of the Nation through its President and commander
in chief, and it remains now only for him who
has been with you from the beginning, and who intends
to stay all the time, to thank the officers and men for
their intelligence, fidelity, and courage displayed in the
campaign of Atlanta. On the 1st day of May our armies
were lying in garrison, seemingly quiet, from Knoxville
to Huntsville, and our enemy lay behind his rocky-faced
barrier at Dalton, proud, defiant, and exultant. He
had time since Christmas to recover from his discomfiture
on the Mission Ridge, with his ranks filled, and a
new commander in chief, second to none of the Confederacy
in reputation for skill, sagacity, and extreme
popularity. All at once our armies assumed life and
action and appeared before Dalton. Threatening Rocky
Face, we threw ourselves upon Resaca, and the rebel
army only escaped by the rapidity of its retreat, aided
by the numerous roads with which he was familiar, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
which were strange to us. Again he took post, at Allatoona,
but we gave him no rest, and by a circuit toward
Dallas and a subsequent movement to Ackworth, we
gained the Allatoona pass. Then followed the eventful
battles about Kenesaw and the escape of the enemy
across the Chattahoochie river. The crossing of the
Chattahoochie and breaking of the Augusta road was
most handsomely executed by us, and will be studied as
an example in the art of war. At this stage of our game
our enemies became dissatisfied with their old and skilful
commander and selected one more bold and rash.
New tactics were adopted. Hood first boldly and
rapidly on the 20th of July fell on our right at Peach
Tree creek, and lost again. On the 22d he struck our
extreme left and was severely punished; and finally again
on the 28th he repeated the attempt on our right, and
that time must have been satisfied, for since that date he
has remained on the defensive. We slowly and gradually
drew our lines about Atlanta, feeling for the railroads
which supplied the rebel army and made Atlanta a place
of importance. We must concede to our enemy that
he met these efforts patiently and skilfully, but at last he
made the mistake we had waited for so long and sent
his cavalry to our rear, far beyond the reach of recall.
Instantly our cavalry was on his only remaining road,
and we followed quickly with our principal army, and
Atlanta fell into our possession as the fruit of well-concerted
measures, backed by a brave and competent army.
This completed the grand task which had been assigned
us by our Government, and your general again repeats
his personal and official thanks to all the officers and
men composing this army for the indomitable courage
and perseverance which alone could give success. We
have beaten our enemy on every ground he has chosen,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
and have wrested from him his own Gate city, where
were located his foundries, arsenals, and workshops,
deemed secure on account of their distance from our
base and the seeming impregnable obstacles intervening.
Nothing is impossible to an army like this, determined
to vindicate a government wherever our flag has once
floated, and resolved to maintain them at any and all
cost.</p>

<p>"In our campaign many, yea very many of our noble
and gallant comrades have preceded us to our common
destination, the grave; but they have left the memory
of deeds on which a Nation can build a proud history.
McPherson, Harker, McCook, and others dear to us all,
are now the binding links in our minds that should attach
more closely together the living, who have to complete
the task which still lies before us in the dim
future.</p>

<p>"I ask all to continue as they have so well begun, the
cultivation of the soldierly virtues that have ennobled
our own and other countries,&mdash;courage, patience, obedience
to the laws and constituted authorities of our
Government, fidelity to our trusts, and good feeling
among each other; each trying to excel the other in the
practice of those high qualities, and it will then require
no prophet to foretell that our country will, in time,
emerge from this war purified by the fires of war and
worthy its great founder, Washington.</p>

<p>Tuesday, the 8th instant, the Twenty-ninth was very
busy holding election. Detachments from other organizations
were permitted to vote at the Twenty-ninth headquarters.
The Twenty-ninth regiment cast three hundred
and eighty-four votes. Of these Lincoln received
three hundred and fifty and McClellan thirty-four.
During the day the regiment was wide awake and
enthusiastic, and gave every soldier a chance to vote.
At 6:30 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span> on the following day, while the regiment
was in tents eating breakfast, the rebels opened a lively
fire with artillery, at short range. The enemy approached
our picket, which was posted west of camp, covering the
Sandtown road, who were surprised and fell back without
firing a shot; hence the first intimation that we had that
the enemy was near was the report of their artillery and
the bursting of shells in our midst. The Twenty-ninth
fell in and took position behind the fortification which
the regiment had constructed. In the meantime a line
of skirmishers was sent out and soon the enemy were
driven back. A portion of the brigade was sent out on
the Sandtown road, marched a few miles, but the Confederates
had flown, and late in the afternoon the scouting
party returned to camp.</p>

<p>November 10th. Remained in camp occupied in the
usual camp and picket duties, and the inspection of
ammunition, arms, and accoutrements, and all was quiet,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
and at 8 o'clock in the evening the city of Atlanta took
fire and was nearly annihilated. Saturday, the 12th, in
camp, and all is quiet. Sunday, November 13th, the
Twenty-ninth was detailed to tear up and destroy the
railroad, and 7:30 marched out on the railroad leading
to Chattanooga, and was engaged until 10 at night in
burning the ties and bending the rails. At night the
regiment returned to its old camp at Atlanta. 14th instant,
in camp; all quiet. A man in company I was
injured by falling from a building. 15th instant,
marched at 6:30 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span> on the road leading to Stone
mountain in a southeast direction from Atlanta, and
at 6 <span class="allsmcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span> halted and went into camp (marched fifteen
miles). 16th instant, marched at 7:30 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span>, and at
5:15 <span class="allsmcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span> halted and camped for the night (marched
twelve miles). 17th instant, marched at 5 o'clock <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span>,
and after marching twelve miles halted for dinner,
and at 2 <span class="allsmcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span> fell in and marched until 5 <span class="allsmcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span>, when
the regiment halted and went into camp. 18th instant,
moved at 4:30 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span>; marched ten miles, and at 12 <span class="allsmcap">M.</span>
halted for dinner; fell in at 1 o'clock and at 6 <span class="allsmcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span>
halted and camped for the night (marched twenty miles
during the day). 19th instant, marched at 6:30 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span></p>

<p>Twentieth instant, moved fourteen miles and camped
for the night near Edenton. 21st, marched through
Edenton in the direction of Milledgeville, a distance of
sixteen miles, and went into camp. 22d, marched at
5:30 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span>, halted at 12 <span class="allsmcap">M.</span> one hour for dinner, and at
1:15 <span class="allsmcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span> fell in and marched until 8 o'clock <span class="allsmcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span>,
passed through Milledgeville and crossed the Oconee
river and camped for the night. 23d, Twenty-ninth regiment
detailed for picket; fell in and moved east about
three-fourths of a mile, passing through the woods and
advancing into an open country; during its stay on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
picket duty some of the boys went out on a foraging expedition,
and it is not necessary to state that they were
successful, and that honey, sweet potatoes, and some
fine chickens (which the quartermaster had left), made a
very pleasant repast. 24th, received orders to join the
brigade; marched at 7 o'clock <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span>, and halted at 1:30
for dinner; fell in at 2:15 <span class="allsmcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span>, halted at 7:30, camped
for the night; marched fifteen miles. 25th, moved at 7
<span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span>, passing through a low country covered with heavy
timber and thick undergrowth; the Twenty-ninth was
train guard; halted at 12 <span class="allsmcap">M.</span>, at Buffalo creek, for dinner;
found the bridge destroyed; parked the train, and late in
the afternoon the bridge was repaired and the regiment
with the train crossed, passed through Buffalo swamp
and camped for the night; marched twelve miles. 26th,
the regiment was ordered up at 3:30 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span>, remained on
arms until 7:30, when it marched with the brigade; halted

and tore up track until 5 o'clock <span class="allsmcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span>, then
marched back to Davisboro, and camped for the night;
nothing special transpired during the night except the
burning of a house, which accidentally (?) took fire;
search was made in the regiments of the brigade by the
staff officers to find out if possible the cause of the fire,
but "not guilty" was the response. 29th, marched at
6:30 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span>, halted at 11:30, at Bartlows station, for dinner,
and in the afternoon marched through Bostwick and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>

<p>December 1, 1864, marched at 7:30 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span>, the Second
division in the advance, passed through a low, wet country,
almost impassable to the ordnance train; halted at
8:15 and camped for the night; marched fifteen miles.
2d, marched at 6 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span>, First brigade in advance; moved
about ten miles; halted at 12 <span class="allsmcap">M.</span> for dinner, at a creek
where the rebels had destroyed the bridge, and while
preparing dinner, the Twenty-ninth regiment was ordered
to fall in, which it did without delay, and marched to
the creek; the enemy was found on its opposite bank in
considerable force; the regiment was ordered to drive
the enemy out of the timber, force them back and hold
them while the bridge was being rebuilt; we loaded our
guns, and crossing the bank four companies under Captain
Schoonover advanced to the right up the road,
through the timber (which was a thick undergrowth)
driving the enemy out of the woods and into an open
field about one mile from the bridge; barricaded the
road with rails, and the other six companies under Major
Wright, advanced direct to the point through the woods
about one mile, the enemy falling back; the regiment
held its position until the bridge was rebuilt, and a
crossing effected, and late in the <span class="allsmcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span> the brigade
moved through the swamp and camped for the night.
3d, remained in camp until after dinner, then moved
forward the remainder of the day and all night; had no
supper; halted at 7 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span> for breakfast, near Millen; the
old stockade was empty, the prisoners having been removed
the day before; after breakfast on the 4th, we
moved forward, marched all day, and at 8 <span class="allsmcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span> halted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
and camped for the night. 5th, marched at 7 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span>,
halted at 2:30 <span class="allsmcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span> for dinner; moved three miles in the

Springfield; marched twelve miles. 8th, marched at
6:30 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span> and camped at 4:30 <span class="allsmcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span> near Eden.</p>

<p>9th instant at 9 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span>, moved six miles and halted
thirty minutes for dinner at Wallhower Swamp, where
the Confederates were found in force. The fallen timber
which obstructed the road was soon removed by the
Pioneer corps, and in the meantime with the Third
brigade, of Geary's division in the advance, had a sharp
skirmish with the rebels. While the road was being
cleared the Second division were resting on their arms,
except the Third brigade, which had advanced nearly
through the swamp. While engaged with the enemy
the train was ordered forward, and the Twenty-ninth
regiment advanced on double-quick in support of the
brigade thus engaged. Passing the train it reached the
Third brigade, which had advanced about one mile and
a half. The Twenty-ninth immediately formed line on
the left of the road in rear of the Third brigade, and
skirmished until dark, when the firing ceased. During
the night the rebels fell back. 10th instant, moved at
7 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span> and marched through the swamp where we
found small earth works and two small field pieces
masked to cover the road through the swamp, but when
the boys in blue were discovered the rebels moved to
the rear. The regiment marched thirteen miles with
some skirmishing and artillery firing during the day and
night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span></p>

<p>When about four miles from the city of Savannah,
Georgia, rebel artillery was found to be in the road behind
earthworks to impede our progress. The Twenty-ninth
regiment, with the brigade, filed to the left of the
road and took position in the timber, where it bivouacked
for the night. After leaving Atlanta, Georgia, on the
15th day of November, 1864, the army was designated
as the Army of Georgia, the Twelfth and Fourteenth
corps, known as the left wing, commanded by Major-general
H. W. Slocum, and the Fifteenth and Seventeenth
corps, known as the right wing, commanded by
Major-general O. O. Howard, Major-general William T.
Sherman in command of the Army of Georgia.</p>

<p>On this march the army cut loose from the base of
supplies at Atlanta, and lived mostly from forage on the
country. On reaching the enemy within four miles of
Savannah, on the 10th day of December, the division
had accumulated several hundred head of cattle. Sunday,
December 11th, moved in the morning about one
mile, and took a position near the rebel lines, the
Twenty-ninth regiment, on the extreme left of the line,
with its left reaching the Savannah river. While in this
position the rebels opened fire with artillery from a fort
immediately in our front, and the infantry from their
strong line of works, kept up a continual fire. The
brigade remained in line until late in the afternoon, sustaining
slight loss, when it fell back through the open
field into the woods and laid on arms all night. On the
12th inst., at 2:30 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span>, fell in and advanced to the
front about one-half mile to the old levee, and thence
filed to the left. Marched about three-fourths of a mile,
halted, and prepared to charge the rebels. To do so
the right had to pass a dike or canal with four or five
feet of water, and assault the fort and breastworks in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
open field. The charge was abandoned, and at 4:30 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span>
the regiment returned to camp, where we remained
skirmishing and artillery firing during the day. On the
13th inst. the Twenty-ninth was on skirmish line all day.
During the night we advanced our line through a woods,
which was heavy pine, mixed with live oak, within two
hundred yards of the rebel line, where they were strongly
intrenched. Between the contending armies was no
timber except scattering undergrowth, and a canal near
the rebel line of works. In this advanced position the
regiment dug rifle-pits, which were strongly barricaded
with timber.</p>

<p>In the lines of rifle-pits our pickets were stationed and
performed the duty of skirmishers, being relieved
every twenty-four hours, which was done under cover of
night. In the meantime the regiment fell back about
one-fourth of a mile, and constructed works of heavy
timber, in the rear of which the men put up their shelter
tents. Here they could partake of the scanty rations (but
dare not sleep), as the artillery firing and skirmishing
was kept up continually day and night on the 14th, 15th,
16th and 17th; and Sunday, the 18th, skirmishing and
artillery duelling all along the line. On the 19th skirmishing
all day. In the evening a detail was made from our
brigade under the command of Major Myron T. Wright,
to construct new lines of works. While engaged in the
work at 7 o'clock <span class="allsmcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span>, he received a severe wound in the
left foot (at which time Captain Jonas Schoonover took
command), the ball entering the foot a little below the
instep, and lodged into the center of the heel about one
inch from the bottom of the foot. On the 20th, firing
all along the line. This ceased at 11 o'clock <span class="allsmcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span> The
Twenty-ninth regiment, with its brigade and division,
has been in position on the left of the road leading<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
from Springfield to the city of Savannah, with its main
line in the timber, its right resting on the river. During
the ten days the command remained in front of Savannah
it took charge of large rice mills on the river, and
supplied the men with rice. The quartermaster used
large quantities for the train teams. At one time rice
sold for fifty cents per quart (before the capture of Fort
McAllister, on December 13th, 1864). The rebels in
our front were behind a heavy line of works, which was
surmounted with large timber called head logs, with port
holes in their front. At their rear was a large body of
timber, their right rested on the river, where they had
constructed two forts, one near the river, and the other
a short distance west along their line, where they had a
strong position behind sand bags. But our lines were
advancing nearer every day, and during the night of
December 20th they evacuated their works, and fell back
to Savannah, crossing the river into South Carolina.
At 4 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span>, on the 21st day of December, the Twenty-ninth
fell in, and moved in the advance of the brigade
to the front. Passing the rifle-pits, it filed to the left,
across the canal near the rebel fort, finding their works
and entire line evacuated. We moved on in the direction
of Savannah. On reaching the city, the Twenty-ninth
Ohio and Twenty-eighth Pennsylvania regiments
moved down the river to Fort Jackson, which had been
evacuated and set on fire. The regiments reached the
fort at 9 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span>, and at 12 o'clock at night the rebels blew
up their gunboat Beauregard. We remained at the fort
until December 24th, with the usual routine of camp and
garrison duty. In the meantime the Twenty-ninth took
an inventory of the ordnance and ordnance stores captured
by the Twenty-ninth regiment and the Twenty-eighth
Pennsylvania in Fort Jackson and other forts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
along the Savannah river. On the 24th instant the regiment
was ordered to move at 9 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span> The Twenty-ninth,
in rear of the Twenty-eighth Pennsylvania volunteers,
marched to the city of Savannah, passing through
it, and encamping on the west side.</p>

<p>On the 25th, 26th, 27th, 28th and 29th, fixing company
quarters, and attending to the usual routine
of camp and guard duty. Friday, the 30th, the
army reviewed. The Twenty-ninth regiment moved
from camp at 8:30 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span>, and marched to Liberty street
in the city of Savannah, where it joined the brigade
formed on the left, in prolongation with the Sixty-sixth
regiment of Ohio volunteers. After review it returned
to its old camp at 2 o'clock <span class="allsmcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span> Saturday, the 31st,
inspection and muster for pay at 10 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span></p>

<p>January 1, 1865, monthly inspection at 2 o'clock <span class="allsmcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span>
2d, 3d, 4th and 5th, nothing occurred except the
usual camp duty. 6th, 7th, 8th and 9th, in camp, and
up to the 18th the Twenty-ninth was doing camp duty,
and on the 18th received news of the fall of Fort Fisher.
From the 19th to the 25th engaged in camp duty and
regimental drill.</p>

"Captain W. T. Forbes, assistant adjutant general:<br />
</p>

<p>"In compliance with circular order No. 144, I have
the honor to submit the following report of the operations
of this brigade, from the capture of Atlanta, September
2, 1864, to the occupation of Savannah, Georgia,
December 21, 1864, etc., etc....
December 2d, the march was resumed at daybreak and
was uninterrupted until Buckhead creek was reached.
The bridge over this place was partially destroyed, and a
few of the enemy's cavalry were on the opposite side of
the swamp. Major Wright, commanding the Twenty-ninth
Ohio volunteers, was ordered to cross the creek<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
with his regiment and drive and keep away this force,
which was accomplished without loss. The command
camped for the night near Buckhead church....
December 12th to December 20th inclusive, a substantial
line of works was thrown up for the protection of
the command from the artillery of the enemy, and in
addition to this two forts, with thirteen embrasures in
the aggregate, were constructed by the command. The
working parties on Fort No. 2 were under the command
of Captain Kreicler, One Hundred and Forty-seventh
Pennsylvania volunteers, and those on Fort No. 3 under
command of Captain E. B. Woodbury, Twenty-ninth
Ohio volunteers. Both these officers and the men under
their command are deserving of praise for the energy
and perseverance manifested in the prosecution of the
duty assigned them.</p>

<p>"December 21st, the enemy having evacuated their
position the night previous, their works were occupied at
an early hour by the skirmishers of the division, and by
sunrise the city of Savannah was entered and occupied,
this brigade being in line in the advance into the city.
Soon after reaching the city, the Twenty-eighth Pennsylvania
and Twenty-ninth Ohio volunteers, under command
of Colonel John Flynn, were, by order of the
commanding-general of division, through Captain Veale,
aide-de-camp, dispatched to occupy Fort Jackson and the
smaller forts and batteries near it. The possession of
the forts and other works was gained with but slight resistance.</p>

<p>"Inventory of ordnance and ordnance stores captured
by the Twenty-ninth Ohio volunteers and the Twenty-eighth
Pennsylvania in Fort Jackson and other forts on
the Savannah river: Forty-four thirty-two-pounders, two
ten-inch Columbiads, twenty eight-inch Columbiads, two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
rifled thirty-two-pounders, twelve twenty-four-pounder
howitzers, one eight-inch mortar, three three-inch rifled
field-pieces, etc., etc. Of the ninety-one guns captured,
fourteen only were found to have been spiked and shotted.
The gun-carriages were broken and temporarily
disabled, and all the implements were broken and
destroyed.</p>

<p>"To the regimental commanders I tender my thanks
for the strict obedience to orders, and the enforcement
of the regulation prescribed in regard to the conduct of
the march, and especially are they due to Major M. T.
Wright, Twenty-ninth Ohio volunteers, who was seriously
wounded while supervising the working parties on the
forts, for the promptitude exhibited by him in the execution
of all orders, and his strict attention to the duties
incumbent on him throughout the entire campaign.</p>

<p class="center">EXTRACT&mdash;OFFICIAL REPORT OF GENERAL GEARY.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"December 29th, a conference of the division and
brigade commanders with the general commanding the
corps, was held at 10 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span> to-day, with the view to the
adoption of a plan for storming the enemy's works, as
soon as the heavy guns should be in readiness to open
fire. Fort No. 1 was finished this evening. The details
from the First and Third brigades continued work on
the other forts during the night, under a heavy artillery
fire from the enemy. Several casualties occurred, among
them Major Wright, a most valuable officer, commanding
the Twenty-ninth Ohio volunteers, who was severely
wounded by a shell. Sloan's battery of three-inch rifled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
guns had already taken position in a work thrown up to
the right of Fort 3, and in the open field.</p>

<p>"December 20th. The usual artillery firing and sharp
shooting to-day. By this evening we had constructed
and in readiness for use in the contemplated assault,
two hundred large straw fascines, to fill up ditches in
front of the enemy's works; also a large number of fascines
made of bamboo-cane. The latter were to be
used for bridging the canal by laying them across baulks,
which were furnished from the pontoon train for that
purpose. The work on Forts 2 and 3 was well advanced
to-day, and would probably be completed to-night.
Three siege-guns (thirty-pounder Parrotts) were brought
down this evening and mounted in Fort No. 2. I ascertained
this morning that the enemy had completed a
pontoon bridge from Savannah across to the South Carolina
shore, and notified the general commanding corps
of the discovery. This bridge was about two and a half
miles from my left. The usual artillery firing was kept
up by the enemy during the day and night. During the
night I heard the movement of troops and wagons across
the pontoon bridge before mentioned, and sent a report
of the fact to the general commanding corps. Leaving
one of my staff to watch the sounds in that direction, I
notified my officer of the day and brigade commanders
to keep a vigilant watch upon the enemy, as they were
probably evacuating. The details on Forts 2 and 3 continued
working through the night, the enemy shelling
them heavily.</p>

<p>"December 21st. After 3 o'clock this morning the
firing ceased, and my pickets advancing to the enemy's
line, found them hastily retreating. Having possession
of their line of works with all their cannon in front of
my own and the other division of the corps, I immediately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
sent a staff officer to notify the general commanding,
and at the same time pushed forward rapidly in the
direction of Savannah, hoping to overtake and capture a
part of the enemy's force. My skirmishers deployed
and swept over all the ground between the evacuated
works and the Ogeechee canal, from the river to the
Augusta road, while my main body of troops marched
rapidly by the flank through McAlpin's plantation to the
Augusta road, and on into the city. Just outside of the
city limits near the junction of the Louisville and Augusta
roads, I met the mayor of Savannah and a delegation
from the board of alderman, bearing a flag of truce.
From them I received in the name of my commanding
general the surrender of the city. This was at 4:30 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span>,
and I sent immediately another staff officer to announce
the surrender to the general commanding the
corps. He had considerable difficulty in passing the
line of another division of this corps on the Augusta
road, but finally convinced them that he belonged to the
Twentieth corps and not to the enemy. In the meantime
my entire division entered the city of Savannah at
early dawn, and before the sun first gilded the morning
clouds, our National colors, side by side with those of
my own division, were unfurled from the dome of the
exchange, and over the United States custom house.
The brigade which led on entering the city, was at once
ordered to patrol it, reduce it to order and quiet, and
prevent any pillaging or lawlessness on the part either of
soldiers or citizens. My orders on the subject were very
strict, and within a few hours this city, in which I had
found a lawless mob of low whites and negroes pillaging
and setting fire to property, was reduced to order. Many
millions of dollars worth of cotton, ordnance and commissary
stores, etc., which would have been otherwise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
destroyed, were saved to the United States Government,
and the citizens once more enjoyed security under the
protection of that flag which again waved over them, exactly
four years since the passage by the State of South
Carolina of the Secession Act.</p>

<p>"Two regiments from Pardee's brigade, the Twenty-eighth
Pennsylvania and Twenty-ninth Ohio veteran
volunteers, were sent down to Fort Jackson, and early
in the morning had possession of it and all the intermediate
and surrounding works. The iron-plated ram,
Savannah, which lay in the river below the city, threw
shells at these two regiments as they flung the stars and
stripes to the breeze from the walls of Fort Jackson.
All the other gun-boats of the enemy had been fired by
them and burned to the water's edge.</p>

<p>"On the arrival of the major-general commanding the
left wing, I was, by his order, placed in command of the
city. Until nearly 10 <span class="allsmcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span> continued firing was heard
in the direction of Beaulieu, and supposing that a portion
of the enemy might still be south of us, I kept one
brigade under arms during the forenoon. Three rebel
flags were captured by my command, which will be duly
forwarded.</p>

gracefully acknowledged by the letter of Mr. G. W. Holloway,
appended thereto, which letter was accompanied
by the old flag, which had been borne by this gallant regiment
in so many bloody battles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Col. Jonas Schoonover.</span> <span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:&mdash;We have the
honor and pleasure of forwarding to the gallant old
Twenty-ninth another national flag, the gift of its old
friends in Ashtabula and Summit counties. This is the
third national flag given the regiment from the same
source. It is certainly a strong proof that its friends
still believe it to be one of the bravest of the brave of
the many noble regiments Ohio has given to fight this
great battle. If the regiment had no other proof than
its old and tattered flags, that alone would show that it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
had been in the thickest of the fight, ever ready to
breast the fury of the battle storm; but its history tells
us that it has borne an honorable part in nearly a score
of the hardest fought battles of the war. Citizen soldiers,
take this flag and bear it aloft wherever duty calls,
and your friends will take your past record as a guarantee
that it will never be dishonored by the Twenty-ninth
Ohio Veteran Volunteer Infantry. Colonel, please remember
us to the dear old Twenty-ninth, and accept for
yourself our best wishes.</p>

Colonels Buckley and Fitch, and S. A. Lane, Esq.:<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>:&mdash;In the name of the officers and men
of the Twenty-ninth Ohio veteran volunteer infantry, I
herewith acknowledge the receipt of the beautiful flag
presented the regiment, and in return I present to you
the old one, which it has been our proud honor to carry
victoriously over many hard-fought battle-fields. That
dear "old flag" which has been our companion through
years of fearful war and carnage, and which symbolizes
our glorious nationality, tells its own story. We return
it to you, but not so beautiful in form and color as when
presented to us eighteen months ago. But whilst its
external beauty has been defaced, yet the great life-giving
principles of which it is the exponent, are all the
more deeply enshrined in the hearts of its defenders, and
Liberty receives through this standard another bright and
shining star to her beautiful constellation. Take it, then,
and place it among the archives of the nation, that it
may be preserved as a sacred memorial, and handed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
down to latest posterity as a glorious legacy and standard
that was borne, as by angel hands, in opposition to oppression
and rebellion. Be assured that it is with a
renewed national pride that we look upon this beautiful
flag presented to the Twenty-ninth Ohio, by the patriotic
and loyal citizens of Summit and Ashtabula counties.
The past history of almost four years in war, speaks for
our conduct as soldiers and patriots for the future. We
promise never to desert this flag, nor will we permit
traitors or rebels to wrest it from our hands. We will
always be willing and ready to unfurl it in defense of the
principles of our glorious, free Republic. Truly our
country's faith has learned a new interpretation of her
standard. The white typifies the purity of purpose which
belongs to her true ruler; the red points to the crimson
tide in which life flows forth a willing offering; the blue
reminds her of her home in heaven, to which all the good
are gathered; the stars in her banner tell of light in
darkness, and she shall learn to range them in a new and
beautiful order, as the constellation of the cross. It is
that flag which has solved most conclusively the long
disputed problem of a free republican form of government.
It was that flag which was so bravely and triumphantly
carried through the ordeal of war by our Revolutionary
sires, and encircled them with a halo of glory
that shall be handed down untarnished to millions of
unborn freemen. It was that flag which, under God, enabled
our forefathers to gain our glorious independence,
and here, in this beautiful land of lakes and rivers, rear
a temple of liberty which stands first among the nations
of the earth, the envy and admiration of all. It is the
flag which we have learned to love and to defend, and
which we cherish in our hearts as the guardian angel of
our country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span></p>

<p>May that same God who has given so many brave
hearts to defend it, continue to preserve it, and may it
give light and liberty to millions who are yet groaning
under tyranny and oppression. But we would not pass
by unnoticed the many noble brave men who offered
themselves a willing sacrifice upon our country's altar
in defense of that national banner. The voices of our
fallen comrades are borne to us in solemn silence by
every breeze that fans our brow. The South is billowed
with the graves where sleep the patriot martyrs of constitutional
liberty, until the resurrection morn. We hold
them dear to our hearts, for may it never be forgotten
that their deeds of valor facilitated the consummation of
the glorious results which have just been achieved.
Though they be dead, they yet speak, and will continue
to speak to the end of all time, and dear to each patriot
heart will ever be the memory of those who died in
defense of the Union.</p>

<p>At Bladensburg we went into camp, and remained
until June 10. Marched to Washington at 8 <span class="allsmcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span>, and
embarked on the cars of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio railroad
and steamed away homeward, bound to Parkersburg
by way of Grafton, West Virginia, thence by boat
to Louisville, Kentucky; moved five miles into the
country, where we remained until the 13th day of July,
when we were mustered out. Repairing to Camp
Taylor, near Cleveland, Ohio, we were paid off and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
formally discharged from the service on the 22d and
23d days of July, 1865.</p>

<p>We have now followed the regiment through nearly
four years of the most arduous service which ever fell to
the lot of any organization of this character, marching
and fighting through most of the States in rebellion, its
pathway marked by the graves of our comrades who fell.
In the interim, hundreds of the brave 1540 who were
upon its rolls, pass under the charge of the worse than
fiends of hell, who presided at Libby, Belle Isle, Andersonville,
and other courts of death, by courtesy called
rebel prisons, where, after being robbed of all they possessed,
and even stripped of necessary clothing, they
were subjected to a systematic course of starvation (and
that, too, under the immediate supervision of that foul
blot upon humanity, Jeff Davis) until their brave spirits
went out to the God who gave them. In the army of
the East, with the army of the West, with Sherman in
the glorious march to the sea, and the brilliant campaign
of the Carolinas&mdash;where there was danger and death&mdash;shone
the "white star" of the Twenty-ninth. The
skirmish line and the advance became so nearly the
normal condition of the regiment that assignment to
positions less dangerous elicited exclamations of surprise
from the "boys."</p>

<p>At length the last ditch, so frequently referred to by
the braggart rebels, was reached&mdash;chivalrous Jeff Davis
in hoc and crinoline begged that mercy be shown to
"woman and children." The bubble secessia burst, and
the command, now reduced to a mere handful, turn sadly
northward, its columns "gaping from the havoc of shot
and shell, and the disease of the camp, and prison pen,
its colors ragged and torn, but proud and defiant as ever&mdash;one
grand ovation to the living, a sad wailing requiem<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
for the dead," and "good byes" are said in the beautiful
Forest city, as each departed for their homes to assume
the peaceful avocations of four years before.</p>

<p>Gradually they have drifted away&mdash;some to a quiet
nook in the country church yard, and others to the east,
west, and south, until now they may be found in nearly
every State and Territory in this vast Union. Annually
they come together in re-union at some convenient point

<p>Each year a committee is appointed whose duty it is
to draft resolutions of condolence to the memory of the
comrades whose "final statements" have been called for
since the last meeting, and this committee <em>always have

the future to find only the roll&mdash;no one to call it, and
none to answer to their names if called.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="GENERAL_REVIEW">GENERAL REVIEW.</h2>
</div>

<p>The following review of the battles, sieges, marches,
and campaigns in which the Twenty-ninth regiment was
engaged, is from the pen of Colonel Jonas Schoonover.
It gives in brief the important work of the regiment
during its nearly four years' service, and should the
"gentle reader" find the descriptive portion of the history
too voluminous, she has but to turn to this review
to find consolation.</p>

<p>Beginning with the service in the winter of 1861-2,
along the waters of the Potomac and its tributaries, and
in the mountain regions of Hampshire county, the
Romney expedition in West Virginia, the advance to
Winchester via Little mountain and Martinsburg, thence
into the Shenandoah valley. The Strasburg march,
which ended in the battle of Winchester, where the
Federal army, under General Shields, and the rebels,
commanded by General T. J. Jackson, at Kernstown,
engaged in a sanguinary battle on March 23d, 1862, in
which the Union army gained a victory. The Twenty-ninth
Ohio done its full share, suffering slight loss in
killed and wounded. The march up the valley to Madisonburg;
the long march to Fredericksburg, leaving the
Shenandoah valley at New Market on the 12th day of
May, 1862, and reaching Fredericksburg May 22, 1862,
a day or two later returning to Luray via Warrenton and
Front Royal, up the Luray valley to Port Republic,
where, on the 9th day of June, it engaged in battle with
heavy loss in killed and wounded. One hundred and
ten were made prisoners. The Twenty-ninth was engaged
at short range in the open field against three times<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
its number over four hours. During the time the
struggle was desperate on both sides. The battle of
Cedar mountain, seven miles from Culpepper Courthouse,
on August 9th, the Union army under Banks, the
rebels under Longstreet, the Twenty-ninth was engaged
in the open field without cover, and sustained considerable
loss. Then followed the retrograde move to Culpepper;
the campaign of General Pope, including the
second battle of Bull Run; and the march to Frederick
City; the winter and spring campaign of 1862 and 1863,
under Major-general Joseph Hooker, at Dumfries, was
memorable for its intense suffering; then came the march
to Chancellorsville, and the battle there, which began
May 1st, and ended on the 3d, in which the Twenty-ninth
suffered heavy loss and was the last to leave the
field. May 5th we crossed the Rappahannock on our
way to Gettysburg via Aqua creek, Dumfries, Fairfax
Court House, Leesburg, Edward's Ferry, Harper's Ferry,
Frederick, and Littletown, where we fought one of the
most determined battles of the war, commencing on the
1st and ending on the 4th day of July, 1863.</p>

<p>We returned to Virginia; moved to New York to quell
riots; returned again; advanced to the Rapidan; reported
to the Department of the Cumberland, via the Baltimore
&amp; Ohio railroad, crossing the Ohio river at Bellaire.
On September 30th, we passed through Columbus,
Ohio; Indianapolis, Indiana, and Louisville, Kentucky,
and halted at Murfreesboro, Tennessee. In October
we passed down to Stevenson and Bridgeport, Alabama,
and up the Tennessee river to Wauhatchie valley.</p>

<p>On November 24th and 25th, we were engaged in the
battle of Lookout mountain; Missionary Ridge on
November 24th and 25th, and Taylor's Ridge and Ringgold,
Georgia, on November 26th and 27th, 1863.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span></p>

<p>In December of the same year we re-enlisted, and
during the winter we prepared for a vigorous and active
campaign in the early spring of 1864. On May 3d, we
left Bridgeport, Alabama, on the Georgia campaign,
passing around Lookout Mountain, Rossville, and Crawfish
springs. On May 8th, the Twenty-ninth regiment
took an active part in the battle of Dug Gap, Georgia,
where it distinguished itself for bravery unparalleled
in modern history; every fourth man was killed
or wounded. We moved on to Resaca, and in the
fight of the 14th our loss was light. We moved
on to Calhoun, Adairsville, Kingston, and Cassville on
May 21st. In the battle of Pumpkin Vine Creek (or
Dallas) from May 25th to the 28th, we met with some
loss. In the battle of Pine Knob on June 15th, the
Twenty-ninth suffered severe loss. Many of its brave
heroes, whose valor will ever be held in memory by every
survivor of the Twenty-ninth regiment, were killed.
The battles of Lost and Kenesaw Mountain were on
June 20th and 27th, and we advanced to the Chattahoochie
river, via Marietta, Georgia, and then to the battle
of Peach Tree Creek.</p>

<p>The Georgia campaign, from May 8th until the evacuation
of Atlanta on September 2, 1864, a period of four
months, was one continuous battle. The marching
through Georgia was a glorious achievement, and will
ever be recorded as one of the most brilliant feats in this
or any other war. In Sherman's grand march to the
sea and the siege and capture of Savannah, Georgia, the
Twenty-ninth did its full share. It was engaged
from December 10th to the 21st, when it entered the
city of Savannah. On January 27, 1865, we moved on
the campaign through the Carolinas, and were engaged
in the following battles, and skirmishes of this campaign;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
Averysboro, North Carolina, on March 16th; Bentonville,
North Carolina, on March 19, 1865, and marching to
Goldsboro on March 24th. After Johnston's army at
Raleigh, North Carolina, and the final march through
Virginia to Washington in May, 1865, we took part in
the grand review, thence to Louisville, Kentucky, on to
Camp Taylor at Cleveland, Ohio, and home. The regiment
was in the service nearly four years, and it is but
justice to state that during its entire term it was <em>never
driven from its position by direct assault</em>.</p>

<p class="center"><strong>Transcriber's Notes</strong></p>

<p>
This ebook was transcribed by a native of the state of Ohio.
</p>

<p>
This book transcription is dedicated to
Thaddeus "Ted" Slade, also a native Ohioan and the biggest
Civil War history buff I know.
</p>

<p>
Some punctuation has been standardized.
Some alternate spellings may have been retained.
Some obvious misspellings and typographical
errors/omissions have been corrected.
Any other changes are noted below.
</p>

<p>Some inconsistencies in human or place names were corrected by
correlating with names elsewhere in the text.</p>

<p>The <a href="#ERRATA">errata</a> from the original book
was applied to this text.</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_60">60</a>: Inserted a probable missing
beginning of paragraph. ("[It] is perhaps unnecessary")</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_64">64</a>: Corrected year in chapter
description from 1862 to 1863. The Battle of Chancellorsville
took place in 1863, and the end of the prior chapter also
indicates we are in mid-1863 at this point in the journal.</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_120">120</a>: Corrected date "August 2st"
to August 1st ("August 1st to 3d, hot firing all the time.").
The phrasing "to" vs. "and" makes a date range of larger than two
days likely, and it's more reasonable to believe the printer
misplaced 2 for 1, than misplaced "st" for "nd".</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_143">143</a>: Corrected time from 6:30 to 9:30
("at 9:30 fell in and marched six miles as rear guard to the
Twentieth army corps"). It's not logical that they would move
from 8:00am back to 6:30am in the journal. The printer presumably
set 6 in place of 9, or inverted the 9.</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_232">232</a>: Corrected the discharge date for
John H. Finneman (confirmed using records found on civilwarindex.com).
As-printed, the date was June 18, 1865. (Source: <a href="https://civilwarindex.com/armyoh/rosters/29th_oh_infantry_roster.pdf">
https://civilwarindex.com/armyoh/rosters/29th_oh_infantry_roster.pdf
</a>, collected January 23, 2021.)</p>

<p>p. <a href="#Page_241">241</a>: Corrected Lysander T. King's
company from "T" to "F" per the company F listing on p. <a href="#Page_206">206</a>.</p>
