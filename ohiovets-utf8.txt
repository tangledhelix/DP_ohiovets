COMRADES AND FRIENDS:

On the twentieth anniversary of the organization of the Twenty-ninth
regiment Ohio Veteran volunteer infantry, Comrade J. H. SeCheverell
was instructed to prepare a history of the same, and the undersigned
were appointed a committee to supervise its publication. Comrade
SeCheverell, after months of perplexing labor, completed the manuscript
which was examined by us in Cleveland, July 19, 1882. It was then
decided to issue fifty proof copies of the work to be put into the
hands of members of the regiment for such additions or corrections as
should be found necessary. This was done, and after the return of the
proofs and the incorporation of whatever corrections they contained,
Comrade SeCheverell visited Akron, and spent several days with Colonel
Schoonover, to whom was intrusted the corrections for that vicinity,
and it is with no small degree of satisfaction that we now present
the work to the comrades and friends of the regiment with our hearty
endorsement, believing it _as complete and perfect as it is possible to
make it_.

AUTHOR’S PREFACE.


In the following pages no attempt at literary gush is made, the design
being simply to preserve from oblivion the record of the valiant deeds
of this, the bravest of the brave regiments from the Buckeye State,
that in the dim, distant future, when each comrade shall have answered
to his last earthly roll-call and gone to the “grand review” with the
many whose bones now repose in that far away country of the orange and
the magnolia, those left behind may not forget the sacrifices made,
and the untold dangers endured for that flag, the beautiful, starry
emblem of a now united people, whose supremacy preserved for them the
blessings of this great country, the best beneath the ethereal vault of
heaven.

The data from which the journal portion of the volume is composed was
obtained from members of the regiment, who certify to its correctness.
Colonel Jonas Schoonover furnished, from Atlanta to Washington.

The reader will mark the entire absence of personal laudation so common
in works of this class, and the crowding of a few favored ones to the
front to the exclusion of the hundreds of equally brave and meritorious
men in perhaps lowly positions. That the fortunes of war brought many
forward with flattering prominence is most true, and that thousands who
wore the simple blouse of blue and carried the musket were possessed of
merit as great is also true. To have been a member of the Twenty-ninth
Regiment Ohio Veteran Volunteers is glory enough for a lifetime. If you
did your duty, it is well; if you failed, printers’ ink will not make a
hero of you. Then let each be content with the happy assurance that he
did what he could for the flag.

The writer would acknowledge in an especial manner his obligations to
L. D. Drum, adjutant-general of the United States army, for the very
complete casualty list at the close of the volume; also, to Samuel B.
Smith, adjutant-general of Ohio, Hon. E. B. Taylor, Colonel Edward
Hayes, Jonas Schoonover, Captain R. H. Baldwin, George W. Holloway;
the members of the very efficient revisory committee, Captains D.
W. Thomas, T. W. Nash, Lieutenant T. E. Hoyt, Sergeant E. F. Mason,
and C. H. Coon; the Ashtabula Sentinel, Jefferson Gazette, and the
Akron Daily News, for numerous courtesies extended to him, during the
preparation of this work; and to each comrade and friend who has aided
him in his labors, to name all of whom would require many pages. He has
conscientiously endeavored to make the volume free from errors. If he
has succeeded it will be the first of its kind. However, such as it is,
it is presented to the regiment and its friends with the belief that it
contains much of value.

  JEFFERSON, OHIO, February 1, 1883.




INTRODUCTION.


The author of this volume has honored me with an invitation to write an
“Introduction.” A book without a preface would be an anomaly: in other
words, out of harmony with established usage; not strictly important,
but answering much the same purpose as the “whereas” preceding the
resolutions of the convention.

I have not been permitted to read the author’s manuscript, yet I do not
hesitate to assure the reader that as he peruses the pages of the book
he will find much to entertain and profit. To the veteran who enlisted
and fought in the historic “Twenty-ninth Ohio Veteran volunteer
infantry” it will be read with especial interest. The eye will moisten,
and the heart swell with mingled emotions as he is reminded again of
the varying scenes of the camp, the march, and the battle. Others, too
young to remember anything of the war, but who have heard the stories
of the conflict from their fathers, will read this historic sketch of
the old regiment with the greatest avidity.

We well remember the author as “Hamp,” the drummer boy of Company B,
his boyish look, with his neatly-fitting suit of blue, and the tenor
drum suspended from his neck, while with nimble fingers he plied the
ebony sticks in beating the tattoo, reveille, or the “long roll.”

He has done a real and invaluable service to his comrades in gathering
up and condensing in neat and durable form so many interesting facts
relating to the work of a noble regiment. So much, at least, is saved
from oblivion.

In writing the history of any war only a mere outline can be thought
of. Anything like a full and detailed account of what happened is out
of the question. Neither time nor space would permit.

The multiplied thousands who carried their muskets and knapsacks
on foot all over “Dixie,” and who really did the hard work of the
conflict, must be massed in history even as in war they were massed
against the foe. Their individual deeds of daring and suffering were
not a whit behind those of the great Wellingtons, Washingtons, and
Grants. The latter were in positions to glide easily into history,
and have their heroic deeds emblazoned and read in the books of every
nation. The former may have loved their country as well and fought as
bravely for her honor, and yet die in obscurity, “to fortune and to
fame unknown.”

Dr. SeCheverell has doubtless done his best under the circumstances
to do justice to the name of every member of the old Twenty-ninth. It
was known as the Giddings’ regiment, in honor of the Hon. Joshua R.
Giddings, for twenty consecutive years a member of the lower house of
Congress.

Perhaps no man during his time did more than Mr. Giddings to create
public opinion in favor of the freedom of the slave. The regiment was
raised almost entirely within the bounds of his old district, and it
was fitting that it should bear his name. But I remember that when
recruiting it a frequent objection to enlistment was that should any
member of the regiment be so unfortunate as to be taken prisoner by
the “Rebs,” he would be forthwith shot, hung, or burnt at the stake,
particularly on Giddings’ account, and that the name would be so
odious in the South, and would so advertise the regiment that every
member would be especially hunted down and exterminated.

I think “Hamp” has failed utterly to ascertain that any prisoner from
the Twenty-ninth was thus punished, although many of the boys were
often in rebel hands.

I have ever considered myself fortunate and honored in having been
associated with such a regiment.

I was duly appointed and commissioned as the first chaplain, holding
the position one year, resigning at the expiration of that time, and
receiving an honorable discharge from the service.

Of the officers of the regiment much might be said. Nobody who ever
knew Colonel Buckley will ever forget him. A brave man, a great admirer
of order and discipline, faultlessly neat and tidy, a confirmed
dyspeptic; yet the most ticklish and fun provoking humor often cropped
out in his conversation and intercourse with men. One morning, away
down between Bull Run and Fredericksburg, when the tired and jaded men
were in line for the day’s march, the Colonel was in his saddle with
his toes daintily touching the stirrups, his pale, clean shaven face
shaded by the visor of his blue cap, from beneath which his practiced
eye swept the whole regiment at a glance, while his well-polished
sword, firmly gripped, stood perpendicular, resting against the
shoulder; with a stentorian voice he published the following order:
“Men of the Twenty-ninth, let there be no straggling on the march
to-day. But if any of you do straggle take Twenty-ninth off from your
caps and put on One Hundred and Tenth Pennsylvania.”

The joke on the One Hundred and Tenth Pennsylvania was fully
appreciated and immensely enjoyed (a regiment noted for straggling).
With roars of laughter the boys shouldered their muskets and knapsacks
for another hard day’s march through the pine barrens.

Lieutenant-colonel Clark is remembered as a staunch advocate of
temperance, whose interests were ever for the men.

Major Clemmer, as a genial, bluff soldier, whose songs often enlivened
the dreariness of the camp or bivouac; and Quartermaster Gibbs, as a
man of prompt execution, who expected equal promptness from others.
Many anecdotes and incidents of them could be narrated by the page, but
I remember that the introduction to the volume is not the place for
sketches of this kind; and I fear that I have already introduced much
that does not strictly belong to this part of the book. I beg pardon
for any seeming trespass in this direction.

This introduction, written in the midst of other pressing duties, with
frequent interruptions, now most affectionately inscribes this volume
to every member of the Twenty-ninth regiment of Ohio Veteran volunteer
infantry; to their wives and their children.

I am happy to enjoy this privilege of saying a few words in Dr.
SeCheverell’s book to my old comrades. My prayer is that God will bless
every surviving member of the regiment, with their families, also the
widows and orphans of deceased members, and that when the battle of
life is over, we may wear the victor’s crown in heaven.

TWENTY-NINTH O. V. V. I.




CHAPTER I.

The South Preparing for War--The Fall of Sumter--The Grand Rally to the
Support of the Flag--Formation of the Regiment.


President Lincoln, in his inaugural address of March 4, 1861, said:
“I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the
institution of slavery in the States where it exists. I believe that I
have no lawful right, and I have no inclination to do so.” The South
had apparently decided otherwise, and continued the preparations for
secession, begun under the administration of, and so ably seconded by
that old imbecile, James Buchanan.

The outlook became so fraught with danger to the Union, that on April
7th a naval expedition sailed from New York to the relief of Fort
Sumter. Its arrival off Charleston harbor was followed by a furious
bombardment of the fort by the rebel batteries of General Beauregard.
The capitulation on April 13th, of the little handful of gallant men
who so bravely defended their country’s flag, was followed by an
outburst of patriotic indignation perhaps never before witnessed in
the history of the world. In an incredibly short space of time the
President’s call for seventy-five thousand men was filled by citizens
eagerly marching to the defense of the National capital.

The rebels meanwhile were busily engaged in appropriating or destroying
the available arms and munitions of war belonging to the Government.
At Bull Run, a few miles from Washington, General Beauregard massed
his rebel horde, and here, on July 21st, General McDowell gratified
the insane “On to Richmond” cry, by giving them battle. The result
was the complete overthrow of the Union army, which retreated in the
wildest disorder to Washington. This event cast a deep gloom over the
entire North (barring the copperhead element). More than twice the time
allowed by the knowing(?) ones to crush the Rebellion (sixty days)
had elapsed, and yet it was growing stronger every day. The North was
not yet awake to the magnitude of the work it had undertaken. The
first patriotic outburst was on the wane; the sympathy of England and
the encouragement given to the rebels by the “copperheads” in the
North, gave a prestige to the Southern cause which, to many, bespoke
the final success of treason. In this dark hour of our country’s
peril, that brave old hero, Joshua R. Giddings, with B. F. Wade,
E. B. Woodbury, and other well known associates, feeling that they
had been disappointed in the acts of another regiment, made up in
part of soldiers recruited in this district, obtained permission to
organize regiment number Twenty-nine, which should be made up as far
as possible, of those in political sympathy with the projectors. The
report of the soldiers already returned from the three months’ service,
and who were generally ready to go again, seemed to indicate who they
wished for commanders. Major Lewis P. Buckley, of Akron, educated at
West Point, was generally desired as colonel, and Thomas Clark, of
Cleveland, formerly a cadet at Norwich university, Vermont, was for
the same reason selected to commence the work. He was accordingly
appointed major, on the 13th of August. Two days later he was mustered
into service, and ordered to report at once to Jefferson, select a
suitable location, and organize a camp. On the 17th he arrived at
Jefferson, and a couple of days were spent in examining fields offered;
at last the grounds of the County Agricultural Society were selected. A
part of company A reported on the 19th, and company B in the afternoon
of the same day. The camp equipage arrived on the 20th. On the 27th
company C reported, and on September 10th, company D, and with this
company came Colonel Buckley, who had just completed his service in the
Nineteenth regiment.

Following are the companies, in the order they entered the service,
with the commanders and the localities from which they were recruited:
Company A, Captain William F. Fitch, was recruited in Jefferson and
vicinity, and Hartsgrove. Company B, Captain Wilbur F. Stevens, was
recruited in Pierpont and vicinity, and Harpersfield. Company C,
Captain Edward Hayes, was recruited in Andover and vicinity, Gustavus,
Ohio, and Espyville, Pennsylvania. Company D, Captain Pulaski C. Hard,
was recruited in Akron, Summit county. Company E, Captain Horatio Luce,
was recruited in Conneaut and surrounding townships. Company F, Captain
John F. Morse, was recruited in Painesville and Mentor, Lake county,
and Montville, Geauga county. Company G, Captain John S. Clemmer, was
recruited in Akron and vicinity. (Second Lieutenant W. P. Williamson,
of this company, who was shot dead at the battle of Winchester,
Virginia, March 23, 1862, was the first man in the regiment to die by
rebel hands.) Company H, Captain Jonas Schoonover, was recruited in
Akron and vicinity. Company I, Captain Russell B. Smith, was recruited
in Medina county, and by transfers, and company K, Captain Alden P.
Steele, was recruited from the various townships in Ashtabula county.

The adverse causes before referred to, materially retarded the
enlistment of the regiment, and it was not until about December 1st
that the different company organizations were completed and the
following staff officers elected:

Colonel Lewis P. Buckley, Akron, Summit county.

Lieutenant-colonel Thomas Clark, Cleveland, Cuyahoga county.

Major John S. Clemmer, Mogadore, Summit county.

Adjutant C. T. Chaffee, Jefferson, Ashtabula county.

Quartermaster O. F. Gibbs, Harpersfield, Ashtabula county.

Chaplain R. H. Hurlburt, Hartsgrove, Ashtabula county.

Surgeon A. K. Fifield, M.D., Conneaut, Ashtabula county.

Assistant Surgeon S. S. Burrows, M.D., Geneva, Ashtabula county.

Commissary Henry Wright, Trumbull, Ashtabula county.

Sergeant-major W. P. Williamson, Akron, Summit county.

Quartermaster-sergeant M. D. Norris, Mesopotamia, Trumbull county.

Hospital Steward E. P. Haynes, Atwater, Portage county.

Fife-major Richard Noonan, Hudson, Summit county.

Drum-major Gurley G. Crane, Cuyahoga Falls, Summit county.

Leader regimental band Chauncey Brainard, Gustavus, Trumbull county.

       *       *       *       *       *

During the interim came the easy days of soldier life. Ah! those happy,
golden days of camp life, when, with guard mount, battalion drill, and
dress parade, the time passed swiftly away, and each heart beat high
with patriotic desire for early marching orders; days looked back to
from the dreary bivouac in the snow, tentless, and with clothing in
tatters, scarce covering the form from the bitter, cutting winds of
winter, or in the drizzling rain on the lonely outpost when sharp-eyed
rebels only waited for the opportunity to send the leaden messenger
of death whizzing in your direction. Sometimes the “boys” thought the
rations were not sufficiently “gilt-edged,” quite too plain in fact,
for the savers of the country’s honor, yet how often, while trying,
almost in vain, with the half-pint of raw meal to keep the soul and
the poor emaciated body together in those hell devised starvation
traps--Libby, Belle Isle, Andersonville, and Salisbury--did the brave
fellows turn with longing hearts to the bounteous commissary at old
Camp Giddings. Fears were oft expressed lest the war would close
before the Twenty-ninth should be permitted to add its mite to the
support of the flag. How needless they were the rolls show; more than
one-third (five hundred and forty) of the one thousand five hundred and
thirty-two members of the regiment, were either killed, wounded, or
missing in action, and one hundred and fifty-seven died of disease. The
colors, too, which waved so grandly in the sharp winter air, that long
agone Christmas morning in 1861, are now in shreds, rent and torn by
the leaden hail through which they were carried to glorious victories.

This beautiful stand of colors was presented to the regiment on
Wednesday, November 27th, by Hon. J. R. Giddings, on behalf of the
donors, the ladies of Ashtabula and Summit counties. Mr. Giddings
spoke as follows: “Gentlemen, officers and soldiers. Before entering
upon the particular duty assigned me on the present occasion, I may be
permitted to congratulate you and the country, upon the completion of
your regimental organization and the perfection of your preparation for
the field. I desire you at all times to bear in mind the causes which
led to its formation. The present rebellion has its origin far back in
history. Its first overt acts were put forth in Congress by subjecting
the people of the free States to gag rules, by striking down the right
of petition, by arraigning and publicly censuring Representatives
for the faithful discharge of duty, by annexing, unconstitutionally,
slave territory, and extending and strengthening the encroachments of
slavery. To these violent encroachments upon the constitutional rights
of the free States, this Western Reserve has from the first, presented
a very general resistance....

“The ladies have prepared a splendid National and regimental stand of
colors, and have imposed on me the pleasing duty of presenting them
to the regiment. In all past ages civilized nations have gone forth
to war under their own banner, on which was inscribed some device,
figure, or emblem, peculiar to such nation. Thus each tribe among the
Israelites had its particular banner. The early Christians fought under
the cross, the Romans under the golden eagle, the Mohammedans under
the crescent. The founders of our government selected for their colors
a groundwork of blue, representing immutable justice and unlimited
power, on which the stars, representing light, are twinkling in the
vaulted heavens, while in mid ether the bird of Jove is floating, a
fitting representation of the ease and power with which liberty and
civilization are gliding over the earth; while the stars and stripes
of red and white represent the vital principles and purity of our
institutions.

[Addressing Colonel Buckley]: “To you, sir, as commander, I present
these beautiful standards, for the use and benefit of the regiment.
On behalf of the fair donors I confide these National and regimental
standards to the care of yourself, your gallant officers and men.
Wherever you go let them be borne aloft and respected as the emblem
of universal freedom to all who seek your protection. Preserve them
unstained, except by the blood of your enemies. Bear in mind that you
go forth to fight the battles of the human race for all coming time;
and should the roar of cannon, the rattling of muskets, the clashing of
sabres, the din and smoke of battle surround you, remember the cause in
which you are engaged, and be assured that if you fall, we who are left
will care for your widows and children. Your own heroic deeds shall be
enshrined in our memories, recorded in our history, admired by coming
generations, and approved by a holy and just God.”

Colonel Buckley replied: “Respected Sir--I receive this stand of
colors in behalf of the Twenty-ninth regiment. I return through you
to the noble and patriotic ladies of Ashtabula and Summit counties
their grateful thanks; and whenever and wherever it is unfurled to the
breeze, and we look upon its stars and stripes, may we then remember
the generous donors and the vow we this day make. This flag, the flag
of our country, which has been our pride and our boast, and which is
respected by all civilized nations; this flag, thank God, shall yet
wave triumphantly wherever it has been struck down by the ruthless arm
of the traitors: and, companions, whenever we look upon this beautiful
flag may it inspire us to redouble our energies to do our duty to our
beloved country, and if God in his providence permits us to return to
home and kindred, may this flag come back with us to bear witness that
the Twenty-ninth regiment Ohio volunteers was in the thickest of the
fight.

“Sir, you have spoken in high commendation of my command. I can assure
you I feel myself honored in having command of such a regiment. It
will be my pride and ambition, with my fellow-officers to make it in
all things pertaining to a well drilled and well disciplined regiment,
one of the best in Ohio. And now, fellow-soldiers, in the presence of
this assembly, and before high heaven, we swear upon the altar of our
country to defend this flag so long as there shall be one true heart
and strong arm to hold it to the breeze.”

At last the “boys’” impatience to go anywhere but here, was gratified
by an order to move to Camp Chase, near Columbus, Ohio, the date
December 25th; and right here it may not be amiss to give an extract
from an editorial in the Ashtabula Sentinel, as showing what the people
of Jefferson thought of the regiment:

“They leave Jefferson with the respect and esteem of our citizens as an
orderly and well behaved body of men. They have been over three months
within our quiet village, during which time no disturbance has occurred
and no depredations have been committed. They have proved themselves
honorable men, the best evidence that they will be brave soldiers. When
they are heard from in the fight we have no fears of a bad account.”

CHAPTER II.

The Departure from Camp Giddings--At the Front--Death of
Lander--Advance up the Valley--Winchester.


Christmas morning, 1861, dawned clear, with the earth bountifully
covered with snow, and soon the busy preparations for this the first
march were apparent everywhere. Knapsacks were packed, tents were
struck, and the camp equipage snugly put into shape for transportation
to Ashtabula, and at 10 o’clock the drums beat off. Then the regiment
filed out of the enclosure, bidding a fond good-bye, many for the
last time, to the old camp, up through the town, where everybody was
waiting to wish the “boys” God speed. “Head of column left,” and
the Twenty-ninth regiment was en-route for Ashtabula and the front,
followed by the prayers of fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, and
sweethearts, that its every effort might be crowned with success, and
that, if heaven so willed, all might return safely to the arms of loved
ones, “when the cruel war was over.” How beautiful they looked in
their new uniform, and how gaily the bayonets glistened in the bright
sunlight as each man kept step to the music.

Arriving at Ashtabula, the regiment took cars, and was soon whirling
rapidly towards Columbus, where it arrived the following day.

On disembarking from the cars, a march of four miles on the National
pike to the west brought the regiment to Camp Chase, where it was
assigned to barracks, and the sweets (?) of soldier life began to
be more perceptible. While lying here, the regiment attended the
inauguration of David Tod as Governor of Ohio, and perfected itself in
the school of the soldier. On the 26th day of January, 1862, the long
roll again sounded; the Twenty-ninth regiment fell in, and marched to
the depot, a distance of four miles. It took cars, and steamed away
for Dixie, passing through Newark and Zanesville, and across the Ohio
river at Bellair, thence via the Baltimore & Ohio railroad through the
mountains of West Virginia to a point some six miles below Cumberland,
Maryland, where it made its first camp in Dixie. There it was assigned
to the left flank of the Third brigade (the Seventh Ohio volunteer
infantry occupying the right), Colonel E. B. Tyler commanding, and
here it may be well to state that from this time until the Seventh
regiment was discharged the service (July 8, 1864), the two regiments
occupied the same position, engaged in the same battles, and endured
an equal amount of the hard service incident to the several campaigns.
The Twenty-ninth remained in active service for nearly a year after
the discharge of its well-bred friends of the Seventh and until the
collapse of the Rebellion. This for the benefit of those who imagine
that only one regiment was recruited in Northern Ohio.

On February 5, 1862, a general movement was ordered to entrap the
forces of Stonewall Jackson, then occupying Romney. The Twenty-ninth
and its brigade took cars to French’s store, and marched some twenty
miles to a point between Romney and Winchester to intercept the retreat
of the rebels. The attempt was futile, however, as those whom the
federals sought had flown ere the designated point was reached. This
march was a terrible one, and told heavily on the men, many of whom
succumbed to disease incident to exposure to the intense cold, the
fording of streams whose icy waters were often waist deep, and the
general hardships, were sent to hospital at Cumberland, and never
returned to duty. Returning the following day, the regiment bivouacked
at a point some eight miles from the Baltimore & Ohio railroad, known
as Pine Levels or the Heights of Hampshire. Here it remained some ten
days exposed to the intense cold, without tents, few blankets, on
short rations, and no cooking utensils. Rude brush enclosures were
constructed, which served the same purpose as Artemus Ward’s window
sash, sort of “tangle the cold” or “keep out the coarsest.” It was by
the greatest effort that the men were kept from freezing. This sort
of thing seemed a pretty tough introduction to the “Sunny South,” but
hardships of this kind became the normal experience of the Twenty-ninth
regiment, and the sunny spots which occasionally intervened were duly
appreciated.

The next move was to the eastward to Paw Paw station on the Baltimore
& Ohio railroad, near which the Twenty-ninth and its brigade went
into camp. February 22d, Washington’s birthday, was duly observed. A
general review was indulged in. The streets were prettily trimmed with
evergreens; and arches, and other pretty devices were numerous. The
Twenty-ninth were domiciled in small and nearly worn out wall tents.

On Saturday, March 1st, as the shades of evening were falling, the
Twenty-ninth and its command marched with two days’ rations, in the
direction of Winchester, Virginia, the object being the capture of
that important point. After an all night’s march the command halted,
and, in a blinding snow storm, waited for further orders. At 5 o’clock
P. M. a counter-march was ordered, and at about midnight the old camp
at Paw Paw was reached. The object of this move was to attend the
remains of brave General Lander to the cars, which was accomplished
on the following day. All the troops in the vicinity were present. At
9 o’clock on the morning of Saturday, March 8th, the command struck
tents and marched to the railroad; at night took cars and moved in
the direction of Martinsburg, en route for Winchester. Some two or
three days were occupied in reaching the former place, as extreme
caution was necessary. A burned bridge at Back creek stopped further
steam locomotion, and on the 11th the command moved forward through
Martinsburg, encamping some two miles out on the Winchester road. Here
General James Shields, of some celebrity in the Mexican war, assumed
command of the division, and the One Hundred and Tenth Pennsylvania
infantry volunteers was added to the brigade. The following morning the
column continued the forward movement, under orders to join General
Banks, in his attack on Winchester. The rebels retreated, and Shields’
division went into camp to the north of Winchester, some four miles out
on the Martinsburg pike.

When the rebels first occupied Virginia General Johnston (commanding
the extreme left of Beauregard’s army) took possession of Winchester.
Troops from here destroyed the Baltimore & Ohio railroad and constantly
harrassed our forces in the direction of Harper’s Ferry and Cumberland.
It was of great importance that the Union arms gain and hold possession
of this point, hence the concentration of Federal troops in this
vicinity.

Skirmishing with the enemy was a daily occurrence, and, on the morning
of March 20th, a reconnoissance in force was made up the valley to
Strasburg. General Shields, with the Twenty-ninth and its brigade,
numbering some six thousand men, moved direct to that point, while
Colonel Mason’s brigade advanced on the Front Royal road. At Cedar
creek a lively artillery duel transpired, during which the rebels
succeeded in burning the bridge. The following morning the entire
command fell back to its camp below Winchester. This was a march which
tested the men’s power of endurance to its utmost. The rain fell
lightly but continuously during the day. For rations the men had barely
one cracker each, and yet they made the entire distance--twenty-two
miles--in seven hours, halting only a few minutes about noon.




CHAPTER III.

The Battle of Winchester or Kernstown--Stonewall Jackson Whipped.


At Kernstown, some four miles south of Winchester, Jackson’s command,
numbering fully fifteen thousand men, was massed, and on March 22d
attacked the Union outposts. The citizens of Winchester, who, by the
way, were about as thoroughly imbued with treason as at any point
within the writer’s knowledge in the whole of the chivalrous (?) South,
were in high glee at the prospect of being rid of those odious Lincoln
hirelings, and some were so sanguine of success to the Southern arms
that they prepared elegant repasts for the victors. However that may
be, the rebel horde did not enter Winchester at this time, except,
perhaps, a few dead ones carried there for burial.

Soon after the firing began the First and Second brigades of General
Shields’ division were moved to the front, and a lively skirmish
ensued resulting in the repulse of the enemy. General Shields was
wounded quite severely during this brief engagement, and at night,
when active hostilities ceased, he retired to Winchester. The dawn of
Sunday, March 23d, was heralded by the rapid boom of artillery and the
lively rattle of musketry, as the advance of the two armies resumed
the skirmishing of the previous afternoon. This was continued during
nearly the entire forenoon. About noon the long roll beat throughout
our camp; quickly the men fell into line, and in columns of fours,
under command of brave Colonel Buckley, marched rapidly, a portion
of the distance at a double quick, toward the point of attack. On
reaching Winchester the regiment halted, came to a front, loaded their
pieces, and remained until the artillery and trains had passed. We then
moved on the road leading to Kernstown, some two or three miles, and
again halted. After some vexatious delay the regiment again resumed
the march and soon reached the scene of the action, which was about
seven miles from Winchester. The enemy were under General Thomas J.
Jackson (Stonewall). His right extending across the Pike leading to
Strasburg, and his forces on his left masked behind a stone fence,
while at the rear for a considerable distance the ground was a gradual
ascent covered with stumps and wood which were well used as cover. The
Twenty-ninth regiment and its brigade was moved to the extreme right
of the line, and, formed in close column, by division, moved forward
through the timber to the attack. At close range the rebels opened a
heavy fire, but we continued to advance, halting at a small ravine
where we deployed in line of battle, and in this position a sharp
and determined engagement ensued. The distance between the opposing
forces did not exceed sixteen rods. Late in the afternoon an order was
given the Third brigade to charge the rebel line. Quick as thought the
whole line sprang forward, and with cheers sounding above the roar
of the conflict, in the teeth of a murderous fire, swept down over
the stone wall and at the bayonet’s point drove the enemy from their
chosen position. To the rear they fled until reaching their artillery,
where another stand was made and a rally attempted. The Union lead
poured into their ranks with such deadly effect that they soon became
panic-stricken, and in the greatest disorder retreated in whatever
direction best offered an avenue of escape, and Stonewall Jackson, the
pride of the South and by many considered the bravest general in the
rebel army, was whipped, and that, too, by a force much inferior in
numbers, many of whom had never faced death before.

To make the victory still more sure our forces followed the disordered
mass of fleeing rebels and captured many prisoners, until darkness
closed over all, when our brave boys returned to rest upon their
laurels upon the bloody field of carnage, bury the dead and care for
the wounded. The result of this battle was a loss to the rebels of
the Shenandoah valley, at that time of great importance to them, with
casualties amounting to some five hundred men killed, wounded, and left
on the field, and three hundred prisoners. The loss of the Twenty-ninth
regiment in this action was: Five killed, seven wounded, two missing;
aggregate fourteen. See casualties at the close of the volume for
names.




CHAPTER IV.

Pursuit of Jackson--The “Long” March--Fredericksburg to Front
Royal--March to Waynesboro.


At early dawn on the morning of March 24th the Union army pushed
forward in pursuit of the retreating rebels. The Twenty-ninth deployed
as skirmishes in the advance. Many wounded Confederates were found in
private houses along the line of march. About noon the dashing rebel
cavalry officer Ashby came from cover and suddenly swooped down upon
the regiment with a heavy cavalry force. Rallying by companies and
forming squares, a well directed volley soon sent the rebels in haste
to the rear. The pursuit of the fleeing rebels was continued until
nightfall, when the regiment went into bivouac near Cedar creek. The
next morning (25th) our columns again pushed forward until reaching a
point a little in advance of Strasburg, where a halt was ordered and
a camp (Kimball), established. Here we remained for some time, making
frequent raids into the surrounding country and skirmishing almost
daily with the enemy.

April 1st the regiment again moved after the retreating army, and
about daylight on the following morning indulged in some artillery
firing with the rebel rear guards. During the month of April the
regiment marched up the valley as far as Newmarket, passing the towns
of Woodstock and Mount Jackson. At the latter place a hospital was
established, and companies G and E were detailed for provost, and
other duties, in and around Mount Jackson, while the remainder of the
regiment moved up the valley to Camp Thurburn and continued the usual
picket, camp, and guard duties.

May 3d left camp and marched up the valley in the direction of
Harrisburg; halted about three miles from town and camped for the
night. May 5th, returned from near the town of Harrisburg and went into
camp four miles above Newmarket, where the regiment remained until
the 12th day of May, when it left the Shenandoah valley at Newmarket
on the long march to Fredericksburg, marched to Luray, and encamped
for the night (marched eighteen miles). Thirteenth, moved at 7 A. M.
The Twenty-ninth, was detailed as rear guard. Fourteenth, marched
at 6, reached Front Royal at 3:30 P. M. and camped for the night.
Fifteenth, marched at 9 A. M., traveled thirteen miles, and went into
camp. Sixteenth, marched at 6:30 A. M., reached Gains’ Cross Road,
and camped for the night, (marched ten miles). May 17th, marched at 6
A. M., and reached Warrenton (distance of eighteen miles), and went
into camp for the night. Sunday, May 18th, remained in camp. Monday,
19th, marched at 5 o’clock A. M., and at 3 P. M. reached the Orange &
Alexandria railroad at Catlet’s Station, and went into camp. Remained
until May 21st, when the regiment again marched at 6 A. M., halting at
10:30 P. M. for the night. Twenty-second, marched at 7 A. M., reached
Falmouth in the evening, and went into camp. Friday, May 23d, the army
under Major-general McDowell was reviewed by Abraham Lincoln, the
President of the United States, with satisfactory results. Sunday,
25th, marched at 6 A. M., and at 4:30 went into camp. Twenty-sixth,
marched at 5 A. M., and camped for the night at Catlet’s Station.
Twenty-seventh, marched some four miles on the Manassas Gap railroad,
and went into camp. Twenty-eighth, marched at 5 A. M. past White
Plains; after tramping fifteen miles went into camp. Twenty-ninth,
marched at 7 o’clock A. M. in the direction of Front Royal, reached
Rectortown at 4 o’clock P. M., and two hours later fell in, in light
marching order, and moved forward, leaving the baggage until May
31st, when at 4 o’clock A. M. it moved forward towards Front Royal,
reaching Piedmont at 9 A. M., and Markham at 4 P. M.; moved to within
six miles of Front Royal, and camped for the night. June 1st, marched
to Front Royal, and at 4 P. M. moved forward some three miles on the
Luray road, and went into camp. June 2d, marched at 6 A. M., marched
thirteen miles, and went into camp. Third, marched at 7 A. M., reached
Luray at 12 M., passed through the town on the Newmarket road, some
two miles and camped. Fourth, remained in camp all day. Fifth, marched
at 5 A. M., marched four miles, halted, put up our tents, and prepared
to be comfortable, when at 3 o’clock P. M. we were ordered to move.
This was occasioned by the close proximity of the rebel batteries on
the opposite side of the river. The regiment marched about one mile
and again halted for the night. Sixth, ordered to march at 4 A. M.,
fell into line at 5, moved two miles, halted, stacked arms, soon fell
in and marched about two miles farther, pitched our tents, and at 6
P. M. fell in and marched back to the place the regiment left in the
morning, where we arrived at 12 at night, and went into camp. Saturday,
7th, the regiment was up at 4 A. M. and marched at 9 A. M. (the baggage
was ordered to Luray and Front Royal; Sergeant C. H. Edgerly and
Private Willard Denison, of Company H, were furloughed home for thirty
days), marched up the east bank of the Shenandoah river, a distance of
fourteen miles, halted at 6 P. M., and went into camp. Eighth, marched
at 4 A. M., halted at 6:30 for breakfast, and at 8:15 again moved
forward; soon heard the artillery firing at Cross Keys on the west
side of the Shenandoah river and mountain. The regiment moved on up
the river and about 5 o’clock P. M. were in sight of the rebels, whose
ambulances and train were moving rapidly in retreat in the direction
of Port Republic from the battle of Cross Keys. The Union forces were
under the command of Major-general John C. Fremont, and the Confederate
army commanded by Major-general Thomas J. Jackson. The Union army took
shelter in a strip of woods at the base of the Blue Ridge Mountain,
near Port Republic, Virginia, and bivouacked for the night.




CHAPTER V.

Battle of Port Republic--The Twenty-ninth Suffer Great Loss.


On June 9th, in the dim light of early morning the enemy began to move,
and soon our artillery opened a brisk fire on them. The Twenty-ninth
regiment, under command of Colonel Buckley, was ordered to fall in,
and at 6:45 o’clock marched out of the timber into the open field, and
moved forward a short distance, when the men unslung knapsacks and
other equipage and, reduced to light marching order, advanced by the
right flank, and when near the rebel position came into line on the
double quick. While doing so we were obliged to pass a board fence;
and at this critical time the rebels opened a heavy fire of musketry,
but the regiment moved steadily forward and took position in the open
field. The rebels in front of our right wing were behind a strong post
and rail fence.

From the base of the mountain to the Shenandoah river was about
one-half mile. The extreme left of our line extended into the timber
and near the base of the mountain with the right flank extending to
the river. The Fifth, Sixty-sixth and Seventh Ohio regiments were on
our left, and the Seventh Virginia, Seventh, Thirteenth and Fourteenth
Indiana on our right. The Twenty-ninth being about the right center
regiment during the battle, and at this time in support of Huntington’s
battery, which was belching forth its shot and shell, doing deadly
execution in the ranks of the advancing rebels. When in close range
the rebels charged. Reserving our fire until they were almost upon
us, the order was given, and with a yell the entire line poured its
leaden hail into the gray clad columns of the chivalry, producing
fearful slaughter, and following with a charge so impetuous that they
were forced to retire from their secure position behind the fence, and
here, for more than three hours and a half, our brave fellows, though
outnumbered ten to one by the enemy and fighting against fate, kept
them at bay and held the position. During this charge it is said that
Allen Mason, of company C, Twenty-ninth regiment, captured the colors
of the Seventh Louisiana Tigers, and Lieutenant Gregory and a part of
company F made prisoners of twenty-five of the same regiment. At last
the little handful, who had so gallantly contended against such fearful
odds, were forced to retire. The Twenty-ninth regiment moved to the
rear, perhaps an eighth of a mile, and came to a halt, holding the
rebel forces in check until the entire Union forces had passed to the
rear. In the meantime the rebels had opened fire upon us with a battery
at close range, which did fearful execution in our rapidly decimating
ranks. When all our troops had passed, our regiment faced to the right
and moved obliquely into the timber; the rebels in the meantime passed
down the road and we were nearly surrounded, and now, for a distance
of nearly two miles occurred a desperate struggle for freedom. The men
fought with the desperation born of despair. Brave old Colonel Buckley
(who before beginning the day’s business addressed the regiment,
saying: “Aim low, men, and at every shot let a traitor fall!”) on foot,
his own and one other horse having been disabled by a shot, rallied the
men, and with sword in hand with them succeeded in cutting their way
through the cordon of gray devils almost surrounding them, and escaped
to the mountains near, where some one hundred men of the different
regiments of the Third brigade, with Colonel Buckley at their head,
bivouacked for the night. The small remainder of the regiment, except
those killed, wounded or captured, succeeded in reaching the main
army. Captain Baldwin says that those who reached the main army of the
Twenty-ninth regiment numbered only thirteen officers and men.

The night succeeding this eventful day of blood and carnage was spent
amid the gloom and darkness of the forest. The men gathered about their
brave commander as if to shield him from the damps of night, their
thoughts turning meanwhile to the absent comrades, many of whom, how
many they knew not, were lying, still and ghastly, upon the bloody
field, a sacrifice to the incompetency of the general commanding. The
day following, the little band began its weary march to the rear,
seeking shelter at night in some unused furnace buildings. The next day
they came in sight of the rear guard of the retreating army, where they
found the small remnant of the Twenty-ninth, who had escaped death or
capture, and who, when they saw their beloved colonel alive and well,
fairly rent the very heavens above with their glad shouts of welcome.

The number of the Union army engaged in this battle was some
twenty-five hundred, and could form but one line of battle, while
Stonewall Jackson’s official report shows his army to have numbered
some _thirty-four thousand_. The Twenty-ninth regiment lost heavily in
this battle. The aggregate was: Killed, 12; wounded, 33; captured, 105;
total, 150.

After the battle the Twenty-ninth regiment moved down the valley to
Luray, where the command encamped for a few days’ rest, then forward
to Front Royal, and on to Alexandria, reaching that point on June
27th, encamping on a rise of ground immediately adjacent to the
line of fortifications. The Third brigade was now composed of the
Seventh, Fifth, Sixty-sixth, and Twenty-ninth Ohio regiments, in the
order named. General Shields having resigned by reason of McDowell’s
misrepresentations in relation to the ill-advised battle of Port
Republic, General Sturgis, who has recently received so much adverse
criticism through the press of the country, for his brutal and inhuman
treatment of his men, was placed temporarily in command. After lying at
this point for nearly one month orders were received to move to the aid
of General McClellan on the Peninsula, and we embarked on transports,
but the order was countermanded and the Third brigade marched back to
its old camp.

July 25th we were ordered to join the force of General Pope, then
marching via Warrenton to the Rapidan river. Proceeding by rail to
the former point the brigade was reorganized and attached to Banks’
Second corps, afterwards changed to the Twelfth army corps, as the
First brigade of General Augur’s Second division. After a few days of
“masterly inactivity” we marched in the direction of Luray. Debouching
to the left on the road leading southward toward the Rapidan, we soon
reached Little Washington and went into camp. While here the troops
were reviewed by Generals Pope and Banks, who complimented our brigade
very highly upon its perfection in drill and discipline. General Tyler
was here ordered to Washington, and Brigadier-general John W. Geary,
late colonel of the Twenty-eighth Pennsylvania infantry volunteers, was
placed in command of our brigade. His regiment and Knapp’s battery were
also assigned to the brigade. A forward movement in the direction of
Culpeper Court House, Virginia (on the Rapidan), was begun on August
8th. Here the Confederates were preparing defences, and at Cedar
Mountain, some seven miles to the southwest of our position, they were
strongly fortified.




CHAPTER VI.

1862.

Cedar Mountain--Battle--Severe Loss of Life--Forward to Alexandria.


August 8th, the regiment moved at 2 o’clock, advanced to Culpeper Court
House, and went into camp; and at 10:40, on the morning of August 9th,
moved forward in the direction of Cedar mountain. Halted a short time,
and the Twenty-eighth Pennsylvania regiment was sent to the right on an
eminence as signal guard. The remainder of the brigade soon advanced,
halting at intervals, as the day was insufferably hot (several men died
this day of sunstroke). At last, passing through a piece of timber,
we approached the open field with a rolling country in our front, and
at 1:30, while making preparations for dinner (near a fine spring
of water), skirmishing and artillery firing was heard on our right,
which continued at intervals until 3:45, when the rebels appeared in
heavy force, ready for battle, and the Union lines were formed without
delay. The Twenty-ninth regiment (commanded by Captain W. F. Stevens,
of Company B,) was ordered to advance and take position in rear of
a battery which had been placed on a ridge. Here the regiment took
position, the right resting on the road, and the left extending into
the field, covered from the enemy by the hill on which the battery
was placed. The Twenty-ninth, with other regiments of the brigade,
was about on the right of the left wing of the line in open field,
while the right wing extended across the road, and into the timber.
The regiment remained in this position, supporting the battery, and
receiving a heavy fire from the rebel artillery in our front. Here
several men were wounded.

At 5 o’clock P. M., we moved over the crest of the hill, to a cornfield
some distance in advance of our previous position. During the advance
to this new position a terrific cannonade opened on us, dealing great
destruction to our ranks. Apparently every cannon of the enemy was
let loose against us, but we never faltered in this march of death,
despite the terrible missiles that were tearing through our bleeding
ranks. Comrades were falling, and brothers dying. The mangled and
bleeding victims of the fury and violence of war were left thick
around us, making the ground sacred on which they fell; but we wavered
not. Reaching a low piece of ground, we halted, and were ordered to
lie down and continue firing. We remained for one hour in the open
field, exposed to this furious storm of grape and canister, shot and
shell. Comrades gave up their lives so gently that it was scarce
possible to tell the living from the dead. The fatal missile struck
the victim, leaving the lifeless clay in the same attitude which the
living body occupied. During the fatal period death assumed a real
character while life seemed but a dream. The engagement had now become
general. The brigade of General Prince came up, and formed on the left
of our regiment. The Sixty-sixth, Fifth, and Seventh Ohio regiments
were formed on our right, in the order named. (The Twenty-eighth
Pennsylvania regiment was not with us in this engagement.)

At a given signal the brigade arose and, with defiant yells, rushed
forward to the charge. Prince’s brigade on the left moved forward
with us. A sheet of flame and smoke burst forth from rebel batteries,
musketry replied to musketry, bayonet clashed with bayonet, and cheers
rang out against cheers, as one side or the other gained the advantage
in this deadly conflict. Daring warmed into rashness, and bravery
into recklessness. Hurrah! we force them back, their line is broken,
a battery is almost within our grasp; when in this moment of seeming
certain victory, fresh columns of rebel infantry rush upon us on the
double-quick, masked batteries open on us at the same moment a most
furious enfilading fire, causing our brave boys to reel and stagger.
An order comes for us to retire, when three-fourths of our regiment
have been placed out of the fight--dead or wounded. Slowly and sadly
the remaining few obey the order, keeping our faces to the foe until
fresh troops arrive to take our places, when we resume our position
in the reserve near Telegraph hill. Each regiment of the brigade had
done nobly, but all alike had suffered a loss so great that the four
regiments together could not show a respectable facing front for one
regiment. As night settled over the field of carnage and of death our
entire army corps withdrew to the position it held early in the day,
but our artillery kept up a desultory firing, with but short intervals
during the night.

The casualties of this battle were: Killed, 11; wounded, 26; missing,
12. Total, 49.

Private George Williams, company F, came off the field with his third
gun--two having been shot from his hands.

During August 10th and 11th skirmishing continued. In the afternoon of
the last-named day the 29th regiment was inspected. Adjutant Storer
reported eighty-three men only present for duty.

The Union army remained on the field three days, retiring, on August
12th, to Culpeper Court House, where it encamped. Our pickets,
going over the battle field on the 13th, reported that dead horses
were piled in promiscuous positions; dismounted cannons, wrecked
caissons, and broken firearms were everywhere, while the graves of
the fallen, singly and in trenches, were scattered over the entire
field, only the freshly heaped up earth marking the spots. In one spot
were the unburied bodies of a boy in blue and one in gray, their arms
interlocked as their brave souls went out to the God who gave them, the
one for the right, the other, it is hoped, forgiven for his misguided
championship of the wrong.

Twelfth, marched to Culpeper Court House, and went into camp. 13th,
put up tents and prepared to live. 14th, and all is quiet. 15th,
another inspection and review. There is one consolation if we do have
inspection every other day, there are so few men left that but little
time is consumed in doing so. 16th, 17th, and 18th, still in camp; was
inspected again, and at 6 o’clock on the evening of the latter day,
struck tents under orders to march; slept on our arms that night. 19th,
marched at 10 A. M., north to the Rappahannock, a distance of eleven
miles, and went into camp. Had only a small quantity of green corn
to eat. 20th, all quiet in camp. 21st, at 6 A. M. firing began, and
was kept up along the line all day; at 7 in the evening the regiment,
under command of Captain Schoonover, marched two miles and halted;
company H was sent forward to the picket line, and the regiment moved
at 6:30 A. M. along the Rappahannock; halted at 9:30; after a brief
rest the regiment again fell in, and marched till 12 at noon without
breakfast; sharp firing along the line; halted until 6 o’clock P. M.;
moved up the Rappahannock river two miles, halted, stacked arms, and
remained up nearly all night; (rainy) no tents or blankets, made our
bed of rails. Saturday, August 23d, at 6 o’clock A. M. the artillery
opened fire, and continued until 11 o’clock P. M.; remained on our arms
all day; at 10 o’clock P. M. moved a short distance up the river, and
the Twenty-ninth went on picket. 24th, and all is quiet; at 9:30 A. M.
the artillery commenced firing, which was kept up continually during
the day. 25th, artillery and musketry firing all along the line; at
8 o’clock P. M. the Twenty-ninth with its brigade moved up the river
four miles and camped for the night. 26th, no rations for breakfast,
but after a short time some green corn was procured, which filled the
bill. At 8 A. M. the artillery dueling again commenced and was kept up
the remainder of the day. The Twenty-ninth regiment moved one-half mile
for shelter, remained here until 9 P. M., when it marched forward until
3 o’clock A. M., of the 27th; halted, moved forward a distance of three
miles, and again halted. At 1 o’clock P. M., moved in the direction of
Warrenton Junction, and camped for the night (no rations for supper
or breakfast). On the morning of the 28th day of August, the regiment
moved at 5 A. M., marched three miles and halted, drew rations and moved
on in the direction of Bristow station, and camped for the night. Heavy
firing in our advance all day. 29th, remained in camp, about two miles
above Bristow station. 30th, marched at 6 o’clock A. M. and halted at
Bristow station, and remained till 5 o’clock P. M., when the enemy was
reported in our rear. The sick and disabled were moved to Alexandria
and other points. August 31st, teams and trains containing camp and
garrison equipage and other army supplies, were moved in the direction
of Fairfax Court House.

During the campaign under Major-general Pope from August 20th until
the regiment reached Alexandria on the 2d day of September, 1862, it
was one continuous march and counter-march, by day and night, moving
up the Rappahannock as far as White Sulphur Springs. On the 29th and
30th of August near the Bull Run battle ground. A very hard battle was
fought, in which the Nationals were forced from the field, and again
late in the afternoon on the 1st day of September at Chantilly, a short
distance from Fairfax Court House, a sanguinary battle was fought,
which continued late in the evening. In this last engagement the
Nationals held the field at night, and on the 2d the Union army fell
back within the fortifications around Washington city. During the last
two or three days of the above campaign the Twenty-ninth regiment was
completely cut off from the main army, as it had been ordered to guard
the quartermaster stores with other government property on the railroad
at and near Bristow station, and when ordered to join its brigade it
found the enemy in the rear, so that it was only by a circuitous route
in the direction of Brintsville, and a forced march that it reached the
Chantilly battlefield during the engagement, on September 1st. Here it
bivouacked for the night, and on the following day marched to Arlington
heights, via Alexandria, where it went into camp.

During the last twelve days of the campaign the Twenty-ninth suffered
severely for rations and rest, it being on the march, under fire, and
on the skirmish line the entire time. When we reached Fairfax station,
on the platform of the depot we found an immense table upon which our
wounded boys were being subjected to the ofttimes bungling butchery
of ignorant alleged surgeons, a number of whom were busily engaged in
depriving the poor fellows under their charge of wounded legs and
arms, and in many cases hastening their death thereby. This worse than
murder by men, the majority of whom, when at home, had never even
witnessed a capital operation, cannot be too highly condemned. (The
writer is personally acquainted with professional men of this sort,
who came out of the service first-class carvers, but the number of
brave fellows sacrificed to bring about this state of proficiency is
unknown.) It was now ascertained that the Confederate army of General
Lee was making rapid marches towards Maryland. To checkmate this
movement our columns were at once ordered on a retrograde movement in
the direction of Washington. Reaching Alexandria, we passed up the
Potomac, crossing at the long bridge, and moving forward to Georgetown
where a halt of one day was made, the command departing the following
morning for Frederick City, Maryland, which was said to be occupied by
the rebels. A day’s march brought us beyond Rockville, Maryland, where
we encamped for the night. At 2 o’clock, on the afternoon of September
5th, the regiment marched to Monocacy Junction, where the rebels had a
short time previous destroyed the railroad bridge.




CHAPTER VII.

Frederick City--Recruits--Dumfries.


The regiment remained at Monocacy junction, guarding the immense
supply trains which had accumulated here by reason of the burned
bridge. Sergeant Baldwin relates that a lot of rebel prisoners passed
Monocacy bridge, one of whom claimed to have fired seven shots at
Colonel Buckley at the battle of Port Republic, but without effect.
About September 13th, the bridge having been replaced, we moved on to
Frederick city, Maryland. Here we engaged in camp, picket, and provost
duty, and a large number of the men were detailed to care for the
wounded from the battlefields of South Mountain and Antietam, September
14th and 17th.

In the meantime we were joined by a large number of recruits, amongst
which was a brigade cornet band, composed of the following members:
George Shaw, leader; Everett Shaw, assistant leader; J. G. Caskey,
Jacob Koplin, Sylvanus Hile, Columbus Ferguson, N. G. Hartman,
Christian Hardag, William Kurtz, George Metcalf, James Lyon, “Bige”
Nickerson, Benjamin Snyder, George Turney, Micajah Rice, Bennett
Wadsworth, Edward White, Frank Waltz, Eli Waltz; Gurley G. Crane, drum
major.

November 25th, Colonel Clark says: “Patiently waiting in camp. ‘Dress
parade’ to-day, the first many of us have seen since May last. Only
about two hundred men in line. Remembering how far our line reached at
Camp Giddings, our force looks small indeed.”

November 27th. “Cold and raw. A fierce gale makes our canvas houses
rock like cradles. We are now having an easy time; that is all but the
men and the mules. Our men go on duty every other day. As to rations,
don’t think any of us will get the gout.”

November 27th. “Thanksgiving.--‘Distance lends enchantment,’ etc., to
turkeys, chickens, pies, and fixin’s that make good cheer at home.
Well, some of us are thankful--that we are here instead of being locked
up in those dirty rebel prisons. Nine of our officers and a large
number of our men have just been released. This inactivity is irksome
to the volunteer who has business at home needing his attention. We
hardly think Burnside will reach Richmond via Fredericksburg unless he
goes as some of us did--as prisoners.”

On the 10th day of December, 1862, the regiment struck tents at
Frederick City, Maryland, and moved by cars in the direction of
Harper’s Ferry. At Sandy Hook a halt was made for the night; slept in
freight cars; suffered severely from cold. The following day marched
at 6 A. M. About noon crossed the Potomac and Shenandoah rivers into
Virginia; marched about nine miles and camped for the night. Twelfth,
marched at 3 P. M. some nine miles and went into camp. Thirteenth, moved
at 6 A. M., marched twelve miles, halted for dinner, passed through
Leesburg, and camped for the night. Fourteenth, marched at sunrise,
passed through Fairfax Court House to the station, where we encamped.
Fifteenth, marched till about 4 P. M., crossed Broad run and encamped
for the night. Sixteenth, marched four miles in rain, snow, and mud; at
12 M. halted for dinner; had a fight with a Pennsylvania regiment over
some rails that had been collected from the fence. These we used for
wood occasionally in preparing our meals.

[It] is perhaps unnecessary to mention that the Twenty-ninth boys
enjoyed good fires to-day. In the afternoon the Twenty-ninth went on
picket one mile to the rear. Seventeenth, brigade counter-marched
to Fairfax station, where it remained until the 19th, when it moved
southeast about one and one-half miles to an orchard, where it
encamped, and where it remained until the 27th, when it marched at 9
A. M.; reached Broad run late in the evening. On the hill on the south
side of the creek was a fort occupied by rebels; the Twenty-ninth
crossed the creek, halted, loaded their guns, and advanced, and a
red-hot little skirmish ensued at the close of which the rebels fell
back. We went into the fort, sending two companies out in the road
leading towards Dumfries as skirmishers. The regiment remained on
arms all night; cold and frosty. Guns are not very warm bed-fellows.
Twenty-eighth, marched at 7:30 A. M., Twenty-ninth in advance of
division. About 10 o’clock met some rebel cavalry; the Twenty-ninth
regiment deployed into line of battle, a few shots were fired, and the
rebels fell back. One man wounded in company A. While in this position
Generals Slocum, Geary, and Green came up; a battery was soon in
position which sent a few shots after the retreating rebel cavalry. In
the afternoon marched through the woods on right of road, in line of
battle, while the division moved in the road; skirmishing the balance
of the day. At dark we halted three miles from Dumfries and camped for
the night. Twenty-ninth, reached Dumfries’ about 10 o’clock A. M., and
went into camp on the side hill in the woods north of town.

January 1, 1863, the regiment and its brigade remained at Dumfries,
doing camp and picket duty, until January 16th, when it was ordered
to march on two hours’ notice, did not march. On the 17th and 18th
nothing transpired worthy of note. On the 19th the regiment passed
in grand review by Colonel Charles Canby, of the Sixty-sixth Ohio
infantry. January 27th, General Geary visited the regiment while on
parade, and complimented us on our discipline, neat appearance, and
soldierly deportment. February 2nd, Colonel L. P. Buckley, Adjutant T.
S. Winship, Captain E. Burridge and Lieutenant Gregory, of company F,
resigned and went home. Lieutenant J. B. Storer was made adjutant, and
Sergeant H. R. Baldwin, of company F, promoted to captain. February 3d,
Companies D and I were detached at Dumfries landing, on the Potomac,
about four miles from camp, doing guard duty, unloading army supplies
from boats, and loading the Second Division trains.

On the 14th some musketry firing was heard in the direction of
Brentsville.

March 9th, Eli Waltz, of Company D, and a member of the brigade band,
died.

April 16th, Companies D and I moved from the landing, and joined the
regiment.

From the 29th day of December, 1862, the time when the Twenty-ninth
regiment entered Dumfries, its duties were severe; the line of
pickets was over three miles long, and over one mile from camp; and
as the rebel cavalry were hovering around, the main roads entering
Dumfries, were patroled at night. Our men suffered severely from
cold and the protracted storms. In the meantime five companies were
added to the brigade. The Twenty-eighth Pennsylvania originally had
fifteen companies; five companies were added to the new recruits, and
designated the One Hundred and Forty-seventh Pennsylvania, with Ario
Pardee as colonel. Our first brigade now consists of the Twenty-ninth,
Seventh, Fifth, and Sixty-sixth Ohio regiments, and Twenty-eighth and
One Hundred and Forty-seventh Pennsylvania.

The suffering our men endured during our stay at Dumfries from
inclemency of the weather, the arduous service, and the scarcity of
almost every necessity, cannot be easily over-estimated, and it might
with propriety go into history as a counterpart of that much written
about, and extensively illustrated affair “Washington at Valley Forge.”

About the 20th day of April, 1863, with Colonel Clark in command, the
Twenty-ninth regiment, with its brigade, left Dumfries, Virginia,
and marched to Aqua creek, which place it reached two days later,
and encamped about one mile from the Potomac river. Aqua creek is
sixty miles below Washington on the river; it was used as a base for
supplies, and a field hospital was soon established. The regiment
with its brigade remained at this place performing the usual camp
and garrison duty, building forts and, at the same time, doing its
full share of picket duty. We are encamped on the hill overlooking
the Potomac. To the north and west is a fine rolling country partly
covered with pine timber and tangled undergrowth. All was quiet until
orders were received to march; then what a bustle; haversacks were
filled, each soldier furnished with sixty rounds of ammunition, and
preparations made for “business.” At 7 o’clock A. M., on the 27th day
of April, the regiment fell into line and moved forward on the road
leading to Kelleys ford via Stafford Court House and Hartwood church,
reaching the Rappahannock river at Kelley’s ford late in the afternoon.
The enemy was found in small force on the south bank of the river. Late
in the evening the Sixty-sixth Ohio regiment crossed the river in a
small boat capable of carrying but one company at a time. The regiment
deployed as skirmishers, holding the enemy back until the division
had all crossed when we bivouacked for the night. The next morning we
marched at 5:30 A. M., the Twenty-ninth regiment in advance; passed
through a low, level country, with heavy timber; halted at 12 M. for
dinner at a fine residence on a large plantation; fell in at 1:30 P. M.
and moved in an easterly direction, reaching the Rapidan river late
in the afternoon. The bridge had been destroyed, so that a crossing
was not effected until in the evening, after which the Twenty-ninth
camped for the night. 29th instant,--marched at 7:30 A. M. on the direct
road to Chancellorsville. About 10 o’clock A. M. General Slocum came
up and orders were received for the Twenty-ninth regiment to send out
a line of skirmishers on the right of the road, which was done, the
regiment passing through an open field and entering the timber, forcing
the enemy back; marched on the flank through the woods and thick
undergrowth for several miles, were then ordered to join the brigade.
We reached Chancellorsville late in the afternoon of April 30th, where
we found a small force of Confederate soldiers who were engaged in
throwing up earthworks near the Chancellor house, at a point where the
roads crossed, one leading to the United States ford, and the other
to Fredericksburg. The Twenty-ninth regiment, with its brigade and
division, were the first Union soldiers to enter the place. A number of
prisoners were taken, and late in the evening the Twenty-ninth moved a
short distance southwest from the main road and the Chancellor house
into a piece of timber and bivouacked for the night.




CHAPTER VIII.

1863.

Battle of Chancellorsville--March to Leesburg, Littletown, and
Gettysburg.


The morning of May 1st dawned upon a scene of bustle and active
preparation for the bloody work which was to follow. Troops had been
arriving during the entire night from the direction of the United
States ford, and the light of early morning revealed an almost solid
mass of blue-coated soldiers filling the open fields and woods in the
vicinity of the Chancellor house. They were mainly from the Fifth,
Eleventh, and Twelfth corps. At about 8 o’clock A. M. the Twenty-ninth,
with its brigade and division, made a reconnoissance in force, and
after marching about one-half mile the division formed in line of
battle, and in this position was moved about the field until afternoon,
when the lines were generally moved to the east through the timber,
the right resting on the road. Moving perhaps half a mile we found the
enemy in strong force, his artillery masked in the road. During this
time some skirmishing and artillery firing was indulged in, and several
of the Twenty-ninth were wounded. Late in the afternoon we moved to the
rear under a heavy fire from the rebel artillery. Reaching the place
we had left in the morning we set to work throwing up breastworks.
The rebels advanced and our skirmishers kept up a rattling fire all
night, while the regiment worked like beavers preparing the works for
the coming conflict. The Second division, commanded by John W. Geary,
occupied about the left center in the order of battle.

During the evening of May 1st the Confederate army were charging the
right of our lines, and for four hours the artillery firing on both
sides was terrific. It continued at intervals the entire night. The
air was ablaze and full of deadly missiles dealing destruction all
around us; the earth trembled under our feet; the rattle and roar of
artillery was like continued bursts of thunder. The heavens seemed
on fire, revealing the deadly strife of two grand armies locked in
close embrace, fighting with desperate valor. The dense smoke was
lightened by rapid flashes of artillery, the bursting of shell, and the
unceasing discharges of musketry, making a scene grand and terrible
in the extreme. At midnight this deadly combat ceased, the death-like
stillness which succeeded being broken only by the cries of the wounded
and the dying comrades so recently beside us in deadly combat. About 1
o’clock at night pickets were posted forty yards from the main line. We
were so near the rebel pickets we could hear every movement. Here we
lay flat on the ground watching for demonstrations of the enemy until
the dawning of another day of blood and death. In the first flush of
early morning the rebels advanced with columns _en masse_ and at once
opened fire on us. This we returned and then quickly retired under a
storm of leaden hail. Leaping over the rifle-pits we soon rejoined the
command.

The Twenty-ninth regiment now moved in a southwesterly direction along
the line of works a short distance, in support of a New York regiment.
While supporting this regiment the Twenty-ninth was under artillery
fire from the right flank. Colonel Clark was struck by a shell, and
rendered unconscious nearly two hours. The regiment again moved into
its old position on the road south of the Chancellorsville house,
where it remained under heavy fire of artillery and musketry, and in
the afternoon our right flank was turned, and the Union army was soon
forced back in the direction of the river, at Banks’ ford. When the
Twenty-ninth fell back the rebels were in possession of the Chancellor
house, and there were not one hundred Union soldiers in sight. The army
fell back about one mile and a half, filling the woods and the road
leading to Banks’ ford. Here it took a strong position and threw up a
line of works and remained until May 6th, when, after being on arms
all night, it marched at 6 A. M., crossed the river at Banks’ ford, and
camped for the night.

During the three days’ fight the Twenty-ninth regiment lost quite
heavily; the killed were four, wounded forty-two, and prisoners
twenty-five.

In this action the rebel loss was officially reported in killed,
wounded, and missing, as upward of 10,000 men, while the Union loss was
about the same. The rebel loss in killed and wounded was greater than
ours, in addition to which they lost one of their ablest generals.

May 7th, marched at 6:30 A. M. It rained hard all day. We passed
Hartwood church, Staffordshire, and went into camp near Aqua creek, and
here it remained until June 3d, when the regiment moved to the south
about one mile, and engaged in the construction of two small forts.

Early on the morning of June 13th, we received orders to march. Tents
were struck, but it was not until late in the afternoon that we moved,
and then marched during the whole night, reaching Dumfries after
daylight on the morning of the 14th.

15th, march at 4 A. M. Halted on the north bank of the Occoquan creek
for dinner. Resuming the march in the afternoon we passed Fairfax
station and Court House on the road leading to Leesburg (marched
twenty-five miles). This was a march of much suffering to the men,
several of whom died during the day from sunstrokes.

16th. Remained in camp all day.

17th. March in the direction of Leesburg. Halted at 12 M., and camped
for the night.

June 18th. Marched to near Leesburg and went into camp. _Oh! How it
rains!_

19th. Remained in camp cleaning up guns and equipage, and all is
quiet. In the afternoon the Twelfth army corps were ordered out to
witness the shooting of three deserters from the First division of the
Twelfth army corps. Following are the names: William McKee, company A,
Forty-sixth Pennsylvania; Christopher Krumbart, company A, Forty-sixth
Pennsylvania; and William Grover, company B, Thirteenth New Jersey.
Lieutenant-colonel Clark left us here badly broken down in health.

Sunday, June 20th. In camp cleaning up for inspection. 21st and 22d in
camp. 23d, 24th and 25th, Captain Schoonover, in charge of one hundred
and twenty men from the brigade, felling timber, uncovering Ball’s
Bluff in front of Fort Beauregard.

26th. The regiment left Leesburg, crossing the Potomac at Edward’s
Ferry, passed Poolsville, and encamped for the night at Monocacy
aqueduct.

27th. Moved at 4:30 A. M. by way of Point of Rocks, Petersville and
Parkersburg, and camped for the night five miles from Harper’s Ferry.

28th. Moved in the forenoon, passing through Harper’s Ferry, then up
the tow path of the Baltimore & Ohio canal to Clear Springs, where the
Twenty-ninth passed under the canal through a culvert, and moving in
the direction of Frederick City, Maryland, went into camp.

29th. Moved through Frederick City in the direction of Pennsylvania,
and went into camp. General Hooker was relieved from command of the
Army of the Potomac, and General George G. Mead placed in command.

30th. Moved north into Pennsylvania, and late in the afternoon reached
Littlestown, where we had a skirmish with the advance guard of the
rebel Lee, which falling back toward Gettysburg, we moved north of
town; mustered for pay and went into camp for the night.




CHAPTER IX.

Gettysburg.

1863.


July 1, 1863, the Twenty-ninth regiment, under command of Captain
Edward Hayes, marched at 6:30 A. M., passed through Littletown and on
towards Gettysburg. After moving some five miles, we halted, and while
preparing for dinner, first heard the distant artillery firing which
seemed to be many miles away.

While resting, troops were passing to the front. Meanwhile some of
Company H had advanced to an eminence, from which they soon returned,
reporting that the cannonading was not far off, as they could plainly
see the shells as they burst above the timber. We were soon on the
march, halting occasionally to breathe, as it was excessively hot
and dusty. When about two miles from Gettysburg, we met ambulances
returning with the wounded of the First and Eleventh corps, which
had been engaged. Advancing a short distance, we found still further
evidence of the fight in the bodies of those who had been killed
in battle, and left beside the road. Late in the afternoon the
Twenty-ninth reached the Union lines near Seminary Hill, and here
batteries were in position. The troops were moving, and the rapid
forming of lines gave evidence that a _battle_ was _nigh_.

The Twenty-ninth regiment filed to the left of the pike, and advancing
about forty rods, took a position in a wheat field, in line of battle,
and here remained on arms during the night.

During the day (July 1st) the First corps, commanded by General J. F.
Reynolds, had a sharp fight, in which Reynolds was killed. The Eleventh
corps (Howard’s) was also engaged. Late in the afternoon the Nationals
were pressed back, and took a strong position a short distance from
Gettysburg, on Seminary Ridge, which ended the battle for that day.

During the night we could hear the moving of confederate troops and
artillery in our front, while at the same time the Nationals were
coming onto the field, so that in the morning of July 2d, the open
field and woods presented a solid mass of troops, artillery and supply
trains.

About 8 o’clock A. M., July 2d, the Twenty-ninth regiment moved back to
the pike, and moved with the division to a position in the timber on a
hill, near the right of the line. Here breastworks were thrown up, and
skirmishing was almost continuous along the line during the forenoon,
and until about 3 o’clock P. M., when the struggle was renewed on the
left, and gradually extended to the center. About 6 o’clock P. M., there
was a lull on the left, and the fight raged with renewed vigor on the
extreme right and center, with Howard’s Eleventh and Slocum’s Twelfth
corps. Late in the evening the Twenty-ninth, with the brigade, withdrew
from the works, and moved back about three-fourths of a mile, where it
remained during the forepart of the night, moving back and forth, and
constantly skirmishing. The entire army appeared to be in motion the
greater part of the night.

July 3, 1863, at the dawn of day, the Twenty-ninth, with the brigade,
moved back to, and took position in the works left the night before,
and about 4 o’clock A. M. the conflict was renewed.

The rebels who had possession of our works were quickly driven back,
and, fifteen minutes after the first gun was fired, the engagement
became general along the entire line, and for six hours the musketry
was one continued roll, interspersed at intervals by the crash of the
artillery. The Twenty-ninth remained in the works except when allowed
to retire to secure ammunition, clean pieces, etc. While thus securing
ammunition the rebels charged the line on our right, gained possession
of the works, and were advancing in force, when that gallant officer,
Colonel Hayes, ordered the Twenty-ninth to fall in, fix bayonets, and
advance to the charge of the rebels in the rifle pits and advancing on
our right. The regiment made a half wheel to the right and advanced
double-quick, when the rebels gave way. An eastern shore regiment took
position next on our right, holding the rebels in check. A battery
was immediately placed in position, a few rounds from which sent the
Confederates to the rear, leaving their dead and wounded thick about
our line of works.

The Confederates in our front were Ewell’s corps, including our
old acquaintance, Stonewall Jackson’s brigade, which fought with
desperation. The rattle of the musketry, which extended from the
extreme right to the left center of our line, had now become
continuous, and about 1 o’clock P. M. General Lee opened a furious fire
upon our lines from over one hundred and fifty pieces of artillery,
to which more than one hundred National guns quickly responded; some
sixty thousand small arms were heard amidst the roar of artillery. This
unearthly din continued until late in the afternoon, when the firing
ceased except at intervals, and this continued during the entire night.

Brevet Captain George Hayward, of company E, promoted for gallant
conduct at Chancellorsville, was killed in this fight. He was daring
almost to rashness, always at the front, unmindful of danger, while his
tender solicitude for his men endeared him to all who knew him, and his
death was sincerely regretted. The rebel who killed him was concealed
in the crevice of the rock not more than twenty paces from our line.
Upon again exposing his person not less than one hundred rifles were
discharged at him; he sprang backward, a shrill cry rang out upon the
air, and brave Hayward’s death was avenged.

A little further down the hill lay the dead body of Major Light,
assistant adjutant-general on Ewell’s staff, who had perished in the
morning assault.

Early on the morning of July 4th the Twenty-ninth regiment advanced in
reconnoissance over the battlefield, and for the first time gained a
full knowledge of the fearful loss of life the rebels had sustained,
full five thousand of whom had answered to their last roll-call. Still
the mystery exists how any rebels escaped, as each soldier of the Union
army had, in the seven hours’ fight, fired two hundred and fifty rounds
of ammunition, sufficient to have annihilated the entire Southern army.

We moved forward to the base of Culp’s hill, and thence left, to the
creek near Cemetery hill, on the opposite bank of which were posted
the gray-coated pickets of the enemy. Rebel troops were moving through
the town, while a force was fortified on Seminary ridge. Pickets were
thrown out to observe their movements and we retired to the main line.

During the day nearly five thousand stand of rebel arms were collected
from the field, in front of Geary’s division alone. Our fallen comrades
were tenderly, though rudely, transferred to the kindly embrace of
mother earth, while the wounded were collected at convenient points to
receive the necessary treatment.

Whoever has followed the phases of the battle of Gettysburg must have
been expressed with the stubborn valor displayed on both sides by the
common soldiers. The dauntless resolution exhibited in the attacks
made it a terribly bloody and destructive conflict, and the unyielding
and resolute front of the defence brought victory. But there was no
possibility of achieving on either side such sweeping and complete
triumphs as are recorded of wars in other countries and in other days,
in a contest between two armies where the common soldiers were of such
a temper and in such earnest as were these. It is a sad spectacle to
see the manhood of two claiming to be Christian peoples thus march out
to a field, like trained pugilists, and beat, and gouge, and pummel
each other until one or the other from exhaustion must yield. It is
revolting and sickening, and it is hoped that the day will come when
disputes arising among nations may be settled by compromise, as two
reasonable and upright men would decide a difference, governed by the
golden rule, instead of resorting to blows where right and justice must
be subordinate to brute force. But in a great battle like that which
we have been considering it is not the soldiers themselves who are
responsible, but the parties who make the quarrel. Hence, while the
mind revolts at the scenes of destruction which the field discloses,
the immediate actors are not to be held accountable. They go in
obedience to the dictates of duty and of patriotism, and while they
may indulge no personal hatred toward those who for the time they call
enemies, they must in battle inflict the greatest possible injury upon
them. In all ages the highest honors have been reserved for those who
have fought the battles of their country--and this is right. For if
there is any deed in the power of a mortal which can sway the feelings
or soften the heart it is that of one man laying down his life for
another. The breast heaves and the eye is suffused with tears at the
spectacle of Pythias putting his life in jeopardy only for his friend.
There is a halo of glory hovering about the profession of arms. It has
its seat in the sacrifice of self, which is its ruling spirit.

The man who stands upon the field of battle and faces the storm of
death that sweeps along, whether he merely puts his life thus in
jeopardy or is actually carried down in death, torn and mangled in
the dread fight, is worthy of endless honors, and though we class the
deed with the lowest of human acts, prompted by a hardihood which we
share with the brutes, and in which the most ignorant and besotted may
compete with the loftiest, yet it is an act before which humanity will
ever bow and uncover. Who that walked that field of carnage and beheld
the maimed and mangled, and him cold in death, could withhold the
tribute of honor and respect? For, could he make that dying soldier’s
lot his own, or that of his nearest and dearest friend, he would only
then justly realize the sacrifice. Our casualties in the fight were:
Killed, nine; wounded, thirty-five; missing, one. Total, forty-five.




CHAPTER X.

Return to Washington--Embark for New York--Return--Transferred to the
Western Army.


The pursuit of the retreating enemy was commenced by the Twelfth
army corps at 1 o’clock P. M., on July 5th. At night we encamped at
Littletown, Pennsylvania, and on the following morning moved by the
way of Frederick to Antietam creek. On the 7th instant we marched
through Frederick, filed to the right, and passed by a rebel spy
that was hanging to a limb of a tree. We moved a short distance, and
halted, where we remained all night. On the 8th we marched over the
mountains in the direction of Sharpsburg. On the 9th we passed over the
battlefield, and camped near Fairplay, Maryland. On the 10th we moved
through the town, and camped for the night near Falling waters. On the
following day we advanced to Fairplay, a small town to the south of
St. James’ college, and the Twenty-ninth regiment, with its customary
good (?) fortune, was thrown out as skirmishers, and during the day
exchanged frequent shots with the enemy’s cavalry, and at night resting
in position on the extreme front.

During the night rebel cavalry approached very near our line, but our
orders were positive not to fire unless attacked. On the following
morning we were relieved and retired to the main line, where we assumed
position as support to Knapp’s battery, which was hotly engaged at
intervals during the day.

On the morning of the 13th instant we rejoined our brigade,
anticipating an attack. Riflepits were thrown up and due preparation
made. The enemy are strongly fortified between St. James’ college and
Williamsport, some two miles distant, and on the 14th he was reported
as falling back across the Potomac. Heavy cannonading is heard towards
the river, and the First division of General Williams advances in
reconnoissance, the Second acting as support. A dispatch states that
Lee’s army, in full retreat, began crossing the river yesterday,
continued through the night and to-day. Our troops are hotly engaged
with his rear guard, and we remain in position until the morning of the
18th, when we move briskly forward in pursuit of the fleeing chivalry,
who were now across the Potomac in Virginia. We marched via Sharpsburg
and Antietam.

While passing through the woods three men were shot by Mosby’s cavalry.
A march of sixteen miles and we halt within three miles of Harper’s
Ferry. At Sandy Hook we remain until the morning of the 19th instant,
when we move forward via Harper’s Ferry, to Hillsboro, Virginia.

On the following morning we are early on the move, advancing as far
as Snickersville, near the gap of that name, where pickets are thrown
out and we bivouac for the night. We remain here for two days, during
which time we muster and pass in review. Colonel W. T. Fitch recently
promoted, and who has been absent on leave since March 28th, joined us
here, and assumed command.

On the morning of the 23d we again moved forward, passing through
Upperville and on to Ashby’s gap, where, at a late hour, we go into
camp. Having marched thirty miles since morning sleep was sweet that
night, with mother earth for a bed, and only heaven’s blue canopy
for a cover. At 3 o’clock on the morning of the 24th we march rapidly
forward through the villages of Markham and Linden, halting for dinner
at Manassas gap, then forward, changing direction by column to the
south-southeast, in the direction of White Plains. Marching sixteen
miles we halted for the night.

The next day we marched to White Plains, and the next by the way of
Thoroughfare gap, Haymarket, and Greenwich, the latter a pretty little
village, settled by English people, for whose protection guards were
stationed, as they were in fact in many instances for the protection
of rebel property. After a brief halt we marched forward via Catlett’s
station and Warrenton, where we joined the First and Eleventh corps of
our army and encamped for the night, then forward again to Kelley’s
Ford, on the Rappahannock, when, after a short visit, the brigade took
cars for Alexandria, Virginia, under orders for New York city, to quell
the memorable draft riots induced by the Southern sympathizers and
copperheads.

On August 23d we embarked on the steamer Baltic and moved down the
Potomac. When near its outlet we went fast aground. This action
occurred about noon on the 24th, and three days elapsed before we were
again on the move. On the 28th, at 9:45 A. M., we round Cape Henry and
strike the swells of the Atlantic. A rough sea soon sends many of the
command to the rail to--well, if the reader was ever seasick he will
appreciate the situation. It is not pleasant to linger long upon this
scene; the recollection of it, even now, almost destroys one’s interest
in sublunary affairs.

On the 29th we pass the narrows and enter New York harbor, coming to
anchor near Governor’s Island at 12 o’clock M.

From our anchorage the view was grandly beautiful with the immense
shipping, Brooklyn on the right, New York to the front, and Jersey City
on the left. On the left of Governor’s Island Castle William (now used
as a magazine) stands out in bold relief. To its right is the fort
which protects the harbor. On September 1st we disembarked and went
into camp on the island. The men are in fine spirits and delighted with
the change.

The troubles in the city having subsided we re-embarked aboard the
Baltic, which, on the 8th day of September, heads towards the sea.
When passing the narrows the guns of the fort thunder a salute; soon
Sandy Hook is passed and we are again in the open sea, all happy at
the prospect of going to the front, the inactivity of camp life with
nothing to do having become tiresome in the extreme.

On September 10th we came to anchor in Chesapeake Bay, where we
remained one day, then passed on again to Alexandria, disembarked, and
went into camp to the south of the town. Two days later and we again
move forward to Elk creek, where we encamp for the night.

September 16th, marched at 6 A. M., reached the Rappahannock at noon,
and here rejoined our old brigade, moved forward to Raccoon ford on
the north side of the Rapidan. General Lee’s forces are massed on the
opposite shore of the river, and as we came up our ears were greeted
with the pleasing sound of rapid musketry firing proceeding from the
pickets of the two armies. During the afternoon we witnessed the
execution of two deserters from the Seventy-eighth New York.

During the last of September we learned of the defeat of the Western
army at Chickamauga, and the Twelfth corps was at once transferred
to the Department of the West, and without delay proceeded by rail
to Washington, and thence via Wheeling, Columbus, Indianapolis,
Nashville, to Murfreesboro, Tennessee, where we arrived October 5th.

After a few days’ rest the regiment again resume the march, passing
Duck river, Bell Buckle, and Wartrace, when the Seventh Ohio halted,
while the Twenty-ninth moved on to Normandy, on the Nashville &
Chattanooga railroad. Here it remained in camp, with the usual routine
of camp and picket duty until late in October, when the regiment and
brigade broke camp, took the cars for Bridgeport, Alabama, where it
arrived on the 27th, disembarked, and camped for the night. On the
morning of October 28th the Twenty-ninth regiment crossed the Tennessee
river with the wagon train. Halting at Shellmound for dinner, marched
until late in the evening, and halted near White Sides, where all
camped for the night. About 11 o’clock P. M. artillery firing, with
heavy volleys of musketry, was heard in the direction of Chattanooga,
continuing two or three hours.




CHAPTER XI.

Murfreesboro--General Greene--The Mule Brigade--Congratulatory.


While at Murfreesboro scouts reported that Wheeler’s cavalry was in
the vicinity, and the Second division (Geary’s) was pushed forward to
meet it, the First division remaining to guard the post and railway
communication. Geary moved forward in the direction of Bridgeport,
encountering Wheeler’s force near the line of the railway. A brief but
sharp skirmish ensued, which resulted in the repulse and hasty retreat
of the rebels. We then advanced without delay to Bridgeport. October
27th the Second division, Geary commanding, with Creighton and Greene
in command of the First and Second brigades, crossed the Tennessee, the
object to open communication on the south side of the river by way of
Wauhatchie valley and Lookout mountain for the relief of General Thomas
at Chattanooga.

Brigadier-general Greene, with three regiments of infantry and four
pieces of Knapp’s battery, numbering about fifteen hundred men, with
a wagon train of provisions, was sent to the relief of the famishing
army at Chattanooga, the balance of our command following as fast as
practicable with the immense supply train in charge. After we had
encamped for the night the signal corps of General Greene informed
us that his command had encamped at Wauhatchie, within six miles of
Chattanooga. The knoll occupied by them derived its name from an Indian
battle fought there years before. It is situated in the valley not far
from the base of Lookout mountain. Knapp’s guns were placed in position
facing Lookout, and pickets stationed perhaps fifty yards to the front.

About midnight General Hood’s division came down from the heights of
Lookout and quietly surrounded General Greene’s small force, and at
once commenced an attack. Greene’s men, aroused from their slumber,
hastily formed line under a most deadly fire from all sides, and one
of the most desperate struggles on record ensued. We were awakened by
the sound of the distant combat, and forming into line hastily advanced
to their rescue. When we arrived Hood’s rebels had been routed and
were flying in all directions, intent only on reaching their mountain
stronghold. There was a regular stampede of the mules, which had broken
loose and were braying furiously. This, with loud shouts from our men,
must have induced a belief in the valorous rebel horde that a large
force of cavalry was charging down upon them, and their fears and
flight was indeed a grand burlesque finale to a terrible tragedy.

General Greene had lost one-third of his force, killed and wounded,
his ammunition was exhausted, and ordering the mules cut loose, he
made a desperate bayonet charge to cut his way to freedom. The mules
providentially moved in the same direction, mingling the thunder of
their tread and their awful voices with the shouts of Greene’s men, and
our own, to let them know that assistance was coming. The effect was to
throw Hood’s rebel army into a wild panic and put them to rout. Three
hundred prisoners and about one thousand stand of arms were captured.
Every man of Knapp’s battery, save one only, was either killed or
wounded. Among the former was Lieutenant Geary, son of General John W.
Geary. The ground was covered with the dead and injured of both the
blue and the gray.

While assisting the wounded and burying the dead, Generals Grant,
Hooker, and Thomas, with their respective staffs, arrived from
Chattanooga. The former coolly remarked as he surveyed the bloody
scene: “Well, boys, you must have had a hot time of it, judging from
appearances.” There was silence among the men, who knew that an army
was cosily reposing but four miles away, which could easily have
averted the terrible bloodshed, but were so completely disheartened
by the defeat at Chickamauga that they dare not venture from their
stronghold to the relief of gallant “Corporal” Greene, who happily
turned defeat into a heroic victory.

The following lines, composed by one of our command, fully relates the
grand finale and


CHARGE OF THE MULE BRIGADE.

  Half a mile, half a mile,
  Half a mile onward,
  Right towards the Georgia troops
    Broke the two hundred.
  “Forward the Mule Brigade,
  Charge for the rebs!” they neighed;
  Straight for the Georgia troops
    Broke the two hundred.

  “Forward the Mule Brigade!”
  Was there a mule dismayed?
  Not when the long ears felt
    All their ropes sundered.
  Theirs not to make reply;
  Theirs not to reason why;
  Theirs but to make them fly;
  On to the Georgia troops
    Broke the two hundred.

  Mules to the right of them,
  Mules to the left of them,
  Mules behind them
    Pawed, neighed, and thundered.
  Breaking their own confines,
  Breaking through Longstreet’s lines,
  Into the Georgia troops
    Stormed the two hundred.

  Wild all their eyes did glare,
  Whisked all their tails in air,
  Scatt’ring the chivalry there,
    While all the world wondered.
  Not a mule’s back bestraddled,
  Yet how they all skedaddled;
  Fled every Georgian
  Unsabred, unsaddled,
  Scattered and sundered.
  How they were routed there
    By the two hundred.

  Mules to the right of them,
  Mules to the left of them.
  Mules behind them
    Pawed, neighed, and thundered;
  Followed by hoof and head
  Full many a hero fled,
  Fain in the last ditch dead;
  Back from an “ass’s jaw,”
  All that was left of them--
    Left by the two hundred.

  When can their glory fade?
  Oh! the wild charge they made!
    All the world wondered.
  Honor the charge they made,
  Honor the Mule Brigade--
    Long-eared two hundred.

Major-general George H. Thomas issued an order complimenting the column
under Major-general Hooker, which took possession of the line from
Bridgeport to the foot of Lookout Mountain, for their brilliant success
in driving the enemy from every position which they attacked. The
repulse by General Geary’s command of the greatly superior numbers who
attempted to surprise him, will rank among the most distinguished feats
of arms of the war.

We moved forward the next evening, and threw up a line of works on the
site of this night attack.




CHAPTER XII.

Lookout Mountain--The Battle--The Regiment Re-enlist.


The line of General Geary’s division now extends along the foot of
Lookout mountain, parallel with the rebel line, and only separated from
it by the creek along its base. For nearly ten days the commissary
stores intended for us have been largely forwarded to Chattanooga,
leaving us with scarcely anything to eat. When on the skirmish line
we often sent our reserves around to the right of the mountain to
secure corn from a field in that location, held by the rebels, and
quite lively little fights would result. Our boys always returned with
corn, however, which we parched to allay in part the bitter pangs of
hunger. As with everything earthly our long fast ended, rations came,
and life began to seem almost worth living, exchanges of coffee and
tobacco were almost hourly made between the Union and rebel soldiers,
each forgetting for the time the hate engendered over the fight for
corn. Our main line was being strongly fortified, the rebels meanwhile
keeping up an almost continuous bombardment of our line from their
batteries on the heights of Lookout. Strong details were employed in
cutting away the forest on our front to enable our artillery to cover
an hourly expected attack. The situation remained the same until
November 23d, when, toward night, the beat of the “long roll” called
Geary’s division to arms. It at once moved promptly forward, formed
line of battle, facing Lookout heights, and advanced to its base along
the creek. Osterhaus’ division of the Fifteenth corps, and Whittaker’s
brigade, of the Fourth corps, now advanced to the left of Geary’s
division. The rebels soon discovered this movement and promptly moved
a strong force down the mountain side within easy musket range, where
they strongly fortified during the night.

The morning of November 24th opened out a simultaneous discharge of
our entire artillery, which was parked along the mountain’s point, the
infantry on our left advancing to the base of the mountain. The First
brigade, led by Colonel Creighton, and followed by the Second and
Third brigades, moved rapidly up the creek to the right under cover
of the woods, then debouching to the left. The First brigade took
the advance and began the ascent of Lookout heights, being favored
by a friendly ravine extending toward the crest of the mountain. The
brigade had advanced perhaps two-thirds of the distance before the
enemy discovered its movements, and now the men renew their efforts,
driving the enemy before them despite the terrible fire poured into
our advance, and after a desperate struggle reach the rocky crest and
disappear in a thick mist (referred to by most writers, we believe,
as clouds, and which gave this engagement the title of the “battle
above the clouds”). The line of the whole division is extended, and in
a moment sweeps down in an impetuous charge on both the rebel flank
and rear. Their batteries are reached, the cannoniers beaten back,
and the guns captured. Onward, upward, with loud cheers our columns
rush to victory, carrying everything before them. A whole brigade is
captured, and Lookout mountain, since famous in song and story, is
ours. This victory was won by Geary’s men, assisted only by Whittaker’s
brigade acting as support. The troops below now came gallantly(?) up
the mountain to claim, as usual, the honors won, as the voluminous
reports subsequently written by their generals amply attest. Geary
and his brigade commanders had no reports to make save that their
division stormed the heights and carried them, capturing the enemy’s
artillery and the entire rebel force occupying the main defenses of the
mountain. Some time after the capture the standard of the “white star”
division was planted on the crest and the stars and stripes was soon
waving beside it. No danger was incurred by this, as none of the enemy
remained except the prisoners, yet it has been written and rewritten as
if it were an event of some importance.

“The morning of November 25th revealed the white star standard of Geary
and the glorious old stars and stripes to the army below, floating
triumphantly side by side on Lookout’s rocky crest. Prolonged huzzas
greeted the victors from below, and to confirm that ‘to the victors
belong the spoils,’ a detachment from two regiments of Geary’s command
take charge of the prisoners, seven stand of colors, and a great number
of cannon captured.”

The rebels had burned the bridge across Lookout creek, which delayed
our further advance a short time. A bridge was soon improvised,
however, and a crossing was effected. The command moved on to
Rossville, where it engaged Braggs’ left, while General Thomas,
advancing from Chattanooga valley, moved up Missionary ridge, striking
Bragg a crushing blow in the center, and Pap Sherman was making it warm
for his right flank. About 2 o’clock P. M. the firing became general
along the entire line, which continued until late in the afternoon,
when the rebels were driven from the field with great loss. The Union
army advanced a short distance and bivouacked for the night.

November 26, we moved on after the retreating army, and at a small
creek near Greysville, Georgia, had a skirmish, driving the enemy as
far as Ringgold and Taylor’s ridge, where they were in position behind
breastwork in the narrow pass extending through the ridge in the
direction of Dalton.

27th. Geary’s division made a gallant charge upon the rebel works.
The First brigade, commanded by Colonel William R. Creighton, made a
direct assault on Taylor’s ridge, while the Second and Third brigades
engaged the rebels in the narrow defile. After a terrible struggle
the Nationals were forced back a short distance. A battery was moved
forward and placed in position, which opened with double shotted guns
upon the enemy, soon driving them precipitately to the rear, leaving
the Nationals in possession of the field. In this engagement the Union
loss was quite heavy.

On the 28th the army moved back, Geary’s division reaching Wauhatchie
valley on the 29th. Resting a few days, when the Twenty-ninth Ohio
regiment broke camp and on December 3d moved across Lookout creek,
marched about two miles west of Summerville, on Lookout mountain,
where it camped for the night. Returned to its old camp at Wauhatchie,
Tennessee, on the 5th day of December, and the campaign of 1863 ended.

At Wauhatchie, on the 10th day of December, 1863, the Twenty-ninth
Ohio, though now reduced to less than three hundred effective men for
duty, almost to a man re-enlisted for three years more, should the
war so long continue, and were given a thirty-days’ furlough home
for the purpose of recruiting. The headquarters of the regiment was
established at Cleveland, Ohio. It remained here some two months. At
last the decimated ranks were filled and, on the morning of February
8, 1864, the regiment bade a second good bye to friends, and amidst
their prayers for success and a safe return departed for the front,
determined to die for the flag if necessary, and, after a tedious ride
of many weary miles arrived at Bridgeport, Alabama, via Louisville,
Nashville, and Murfreesboro, where it went into winter quarters and
remained until the opening of the spring campaign of 1864.




CHAPTER XIII.

Shelmound--Wauhatchie Valley--Ringgold--Battle of Dug or Mill Creek Gap
or Buzzard’s Roost--On the Move.


On the morning of May 3, 1864, at 10 o’clock, we broke camp, crossed
the Tennessee river, and moved eastward along its south bank to
Shelmound, where we encamped for the night. On the following day the
march was resumed, the column halting for dinner in Wauhatchie valley.
Crossing Lookout Creek and mountain, we encamped for the night on its
east side and two miles distant from Chattanooga. The column resumed
its line of march at 7 A. M., on the 5th. Moving cautiously during the
day, in the advance, it halted for the night a short distance west
of Ringgold, Georgia. At daybreak on the following morning we moved
forward, and about 9 o’clock formed line of battle, remaining here
during the day and subsequent night. The beat of the “long roll” on the
following morning called us to arms, and we immediately advanced in
line of battle. When near Gordon’s Springs General Kilpatrick passed
to our right with his command. Our column came to a halt for the night
near Tunnel hill.

At about 11 A. M., on May 8th, we pushed forward in order of columns
right in front, and at 3 o’clock arrived in front of John’s Mountain at
Rocky Face Ridge, on the summit of which the enemy were entrenched in
force. The Twenty-ninth Ohio regiment and Twenty-eighth Pennsylvania
of the First brigade, Colonel Candy commanding, with three regiments
of Buschbeck’s Second brigade, formed in line, the latter on the
right, and in this order at once moved forward to storm the ridge.
The position of the Twenty-ninth regiment in the assaulting column
was on the extreme left, the Twenty-eighth Pennsylvania next on its
right, connecting with the Second brigade. Our instructions were to
make a strong demonstration, and to carry, if possible, the rebel
position. While advancing to the assault, the brass bands in our
rear indiscreetly commenced playing National airs, which attracted
the attention of the rebel commander, who rapidly concentrated
reinforcements in our front. The advance up the declivity was nearly
as difficult as Lookout Mountain, and more completely fortified. Its
summit was steep, precipitous, and covered with scraggy rocks and
immense boulders. From our position we commanded a fine view of Dug
Gap, a narrow, artificial cut through the rocky summit, connecting with
a road extending almost parallel with the ridge to the gap beyond,
and by a zigzag course reaching the mountain’s base. The rebels had
so completely fortified themselves that it was next to impossible for
our assaulting force to get nearer than their base. As we approached
the rebel line, a regiment was moved by left flank across our front.
At this moment the rebel line opened a fire so deadly in effect that
the regiment in our front became disordered and broke through our
ranks to the rear, causing a momentary confusion in the ranks of the
Twenty-ninth regiment. At this moment the order was given to advance,
which was executed with a rush despite the deadly volleys that were
cutting through our ranks. Up! up! we go to death or victory! and
commenced to scale the obstructions close to their works; and now a
storm of deadly missiles are hurled against us. Rocks, boulders, and
even cart-wheels come crashing down upon us. Yet we moved steadily in
the deadly advance until ordered back by our officers, when we retired
a few paces to reform our line, the fallen trees only separating us
from the enemy.

Here we made a determined and bloody fight, but having no support to
cover our flank we were subjected to a deadly cross-fire from the
left, yet the regiment stubbornly stood its ground, returning shot for
shot until its ammunition was exhausted. More was secured from the
cartridge-boxes of the dead and wounded, and with this we fought on,
determined to hold the position until reinforcements should reach us.
Just before dusk an order came from the commanding general for the
Twenty-ninth regiment to retire, all the other regiments having done
so some time previous. To cover our retreat a line of skirmishers was
thrown out, composed of men from each company who volunteered for this
dangerous duty, and right nobly did they perform this work, firing with
deadly precision as they retired from the field into the valley below,
where the Twenty-ninth were already in bivouac, and comrades cheered
lustily as the skirmishers came in, happy to know they had not met the
fate of others.

John Davis, of company B, a Scotchman by birth and one of the best
shots in the regiment, fired the last shot in this day’s action, and
was the last to leave the field.

The Twenty-ninth regiment in this fight distinguished itself by brave
conduct, though at last compelled to retire from lack of support. Our
losses in killed and wounded was more than double that of any other
regiment engaged: Killed, 26; wounded, 67; captured 1; total 94.

General Geary highly complimented the regiment for its gallantry,
remarking that he never saw men advance under such murderous fire,
especially when unsupported and where the chances of success were so
desperate. The Twenty-ninth regiment lost nearly one-third its numbers
during this three hours’ engagement, and many were the individual
acts of heroism displayed, which it would give the writer pleasure to
record. As but few are now remembered, the remainder would suffer an
injustice were these given. It is, however, but simple justice to state
that the regiment fully sustained its previous reputation as a fighting
organization, each individual doing his full share in the terrible
work. Subsequent events proved that this assault was made to draw the
enemy to this point, thus giving McPherson’s corps and Kilpatrick’s
cavalry an opportunity to possess Snake Creek Gap, a desirable
situation several miles in our right rear, opening a flank movement
directly on the enemy’s rear.

On May 9th we encamp at Mill Creek, near Johns Mountain, where we
remain until 12 o’clock, midnight. We then move to the right and throw
up earthworks. May 10th we are still at work. We receive the news
of General Grant’s victory over General Lee at the Wilderness, near
Chancellorsville, Virginia, where our regiment received such a baptism
of blood a little more than a year since. Alas! how many of our brave
boys have gone down to death since then.

May 11th. Still in the same position, hourly expecting orders to move;
quartermasters remove all extra baggage to the rear; all men unable
for active service sent to hospital, and everything possible put into
perfect fighting order, and by the way it’s ever so much nicer penning
these lines here in our cosy room in the far away Western Reserve of
the Buckeye State than was the actual experience in Secessia during
those early May days of 1864.

On the 12th instant we moved forward to Snake Creek Gap, forming a
junction with the Fifteenth and Sixteenth corps (McPherson’s), where we
remained during the night. At 2 o’clock P. M. on the following day we
advanced toward Resaca, fully occupying Snake Creek Gap. Our cavalry
are sharply engaged with the enemy. Here brave General Kilpatrick is
wounded. At 4 o’clock P. M. the battle is still raging fiercely, and the
enemy are being slowly driven back. At last a hill is captured which
covers the entire rebel line. Here we fortify and rest for the night.

May 14th a severe engagement opens near Resaca; we advance by a
circuitous route to the left; the Fourteenth corps is engaged; during
the afternoon we joined our Twentieth corps and moving rapidly to
the left; succeeded in rescuing a portion of the Fourth corps from
disaster and defeat, and one of its batteries from certain capture,
the infantry support having been driven back, leaving the battery at
the mercy of the rebels. Robinson’s brigade, of Williams’ division,
Twentieth corps, who were in the advance, fortunately reached the
scene of action in time to prevent the capture of another battery by
making a counter-charge on the advancing rebel legions. We came up soon
after this support, which soon ended in the complete repulse of the
rebels, driving them beyond their fortifications. The Twentieth army
corps received the compliments of the commanding general, Hooker, for
their gallant work, which resulted in a loss to the enemy of some four
hundred men killed and wounded.




CHAPTER XIV.

Battle of Resaca, Georgia--In Pursuit of the Fleeing Chivalry (?)


At an early hour on the morning of May 15th sharp skirmishing opened
along our entire front. General Geary’s Second division moved a short
distance to the left and halted for orders. About 11 o’clock Generals
Sherman, Hooker, and Thomas, with their respective staffs, reached the
battlefield and immediately held a council of war. General Hooker is
requested to assume command of selected troops to take the offensive,
and is asked how large a force he required to capture a certain fort
directly in our front, known to be the enemy’s stronghold and the key
to his position. Hooker astonished his superiors by replying: “Geary’s
division can, I think, carry that position if it can be done by
anyone.” As this conversation was heard by our men we were prepared for
what was to follow.

As soon as General Geary had received his instructions, the Second
division moved to the attack in the following orders: Second and Third
brigades in the advance, with the First brigade closely massed in their
rear, the latter advancing closely in support of the attacking column.
Our advance was met with obstinate resistance, yet we steadily pushed
forward, driving the enemy back and gaining possession of three lines
of hills in rapid succession, the last of which was in close proximity
to the rebel fort, only a narrow ravine intervening. The enemy are
strongly entrenched in earthworks extending in the rear of the fort.
The First brigade commenced a rapid firing at short range to cover the
sortie being made by regiments of the Second and Third brigades. These
regiments rush gallantly forward to the assault. They are repulsed
but quickly reform, and, with other regiments sent to their support,
they again pass forward. The fort was captured and lost three times
in succession, but at last the rebels are forced to flee before our
furious charge. Leaving the guns they join the main line.

The Union forces prevented the rebels from again occupying the fort
until dark, when detachments from the Twenty-ninth and other Ohio
regiments of the First brigade were sent to open a trench through the
earthworks of the fort through which to move the guns into the ravine
below. The rebels discovering this charged down upon us to recapture
the guns. Expecting such an attack the First brigade had moved forward
into the ravine, and now waited the coming of the rebels. When close
upon them a signal was given, which was followed by a sheet of flame
along our whole line, dealing terrible destruction into the rebel
ranks, immediately followed by a determined bayonet charge, which threw
their lines into disorder and they fled panic-stricken over their
fortifications, closely pursued by our command, whose loud huzzas sent
Johnston’s army in rapid retreat, abandoned all its cannon, hospital,
and commissary stores, and with their usual savagery leaving their own
dead and wounded upon the field. We also captured many prisoners.

This success was a grand victory for the “white star” division of
the Twentieth corps, yet not unattended with losses, which were,
however, light in comparison with those of the enemy. In fact, in the
night attack we had so thoroughly surprised the enemy that but feeble
resistance was made.

At an early hour on the morning of May 16th we pushed rapidly forward
in pursuit of the retreating rebels. At 9 o’clock A. M. we came into
line on the bank of the Coosa river, near the railroad bridge, which
our cavalry had prevented the rebels from burning, though they had made
repeated efforts to do so. The enemy’s flight was so rapid that he had
not even time to seriously impair the railroad track. Our locomotives,
with trains of supplies, soon came in sight. We now advanced across the
river and encamped for the night.

At 12 M. on May 17th, the general forward movement of our army was
resumed. The Twenty-ninth regiment was the advance guard of its
division, and assisted in driving the rebels from the little village
of Calhoun, where we halt for the night. At 5 o’clock on the following
morning we again moved forward in the direction of Rome, Georgia. At
Rome cross-roads the rebels were met and promptly engaged by the Fourth
corps; a lively fight ensued, resulting in slight losses on both sides.
The enemy retreated, and we continued the pursuit until 9 o’clock P. M.,
when we encamped for the night.

On the next morning at early dawn we pushed forward, continuing until
3 o’clock P. M., when we halt and form line near Kingston, Georgia.
The whole force of the enemy are immediately on our front, and the
Fourth corps promptly open fire upon them, which resulted in a further
movement of the chivalry to the rear.

We remain here until the morning of May 23d when we move about daylight
via Cassville and Cass station to the Etowah river, which is crossed on
pontoons, and a halt for the night made on its opposite bank. The next
morning we resume the weary march, coming into line of battle at about
9 A. M. We advanced in this order up the Raccoon hills, or Allatoona
range, until night, when we encamp at Burnt Hickory. The First brigade,
as advance guard, moved ahead at daybreak, via the Burnt Hickory road.




CHAPTER XV.

Pumpkin Vine Creek--Dallas, or New Hope Church--Slight
Unpleasantness--Personal.


At Pumpkin Vine creek we discover the enemy and drive back his
skirmishers, who are stationed on its opposite bank, recovering the
bridge, which we cross and throw out skirmishers on the opposite side.
While this was being accomplished, General Hooker and Staff, with a
small body guard, pushed ahead to reconnoiter. He had not advanced far,
however, when he was attacked by a force of rebel sharp shooters. He
now came tearing back into our lines shouting to General Geary to move
his First brigade into position to hold the enemy in check until the
Second and Third brigades should come up, they being some four miles
in our rear. We quickly formed line by columns to the right and left,
the Twenty-ninth Ohio occupying position on the extreme left, Knapp’s
battery taking position immediately in our rear, to cover the bridge in
case we were forced to retire before reinforcements should reach us. As
the left company of the Twenty-ninth were completing the battle-line a
rebel column was found marching in close proximity to our flank.

Ten paces to the front the skirmishers were hotly engaged, but our
flank was uncovered. We immediately face to the left and prepare to
fire, but are prevented by instructions not to draw on a general
engagement but to hold the position at all hazards. The rebel column on
our flank, however, slowly retired without firing a gun, and forming
on their main line, which was massed in the woods a short distance
to our front. During this time we hastily changed front in form of a
semi-circle to protect us from flank attack. This movement was executed
none too soon, as the enemy came immediately to the attack, and a
sharp engagement opened all along the line, which was a hot one, yet
it gallantly held its own until the balance of its division came up.
Forming in column with us, we advance on the rebel line and drive them
slowly back.

The battle now became fierce and our assaults were heroically met.
Generals Hooker and Geary were present and ordered the attack, the
plan of which was to advance lines and fire, to be followed by bayonet
charges, by which the enemy was steadily driven back. Our front line
was frequently relieved by columns from the rear, thus keeping fresh
men at the front. Geary’s division alone had driven Hood’s rebel corps
back to the forks of the road at New Hope church, when Butterfield’s
Third division arrived and took position on our left. Soon after,
Williams came up with the First division and passed to the front, which
allowed the Second division to drop in the reserve long enough to clean
our firearms and replenish cartridge-boxes, when we again advance in
support of the First and Third divisions.

Just as the sun disappeared in the western horizon, General Geary
ordered the First brigade to charge the enemy. This movement was
executed on the double-quick, and as our columns passed in perfect
alignment to the front, Butterfield’s and Williams’ commands greeted
us with hearty cheers of genuine admiration. Onward the column rushes,
and closing with the enemy delivers a terrible volley. The charge is
continued, the air resounding with defiant cheers as the enemy is
driven from the field and down a hill at a brisk run. It was now
beginning to grow dark, and the impetuous rush of the men soon brought
them within a short distance of a line of brush-covered work which
concealed the enemy’s batteries, who at once opened a terrific and
deadly fire of grape and canister into our ranks. Instantly falling
on the ground, we deliver so destructive a fire on their cannoniers
that their guns are soon silenced. Our left being without support, an
attempt to carry their works was extremely hazardous. The regiment on
our right had already retired some distance to our right rear, making
the situation of the Twenty-ninth regiment one of great danger, but
owing to the darkness we knew nothing of it until an officer of Geary’s
staff came forward with an order to fall back, when we retired to a
position some forty paces from the rebel line.

The enemy had now ceased firing, and perfect silence reigned, only
broken by the groans of the wounded and dying. The Twenty-ninth
regiment had suffered severe loss, and only the favorable depression in
its front saved it from annihilation. W. F. Stevens, captain of company
B, was wounded in this action.

The Fifth Ohio, on our right on higher ground, suffered fearfully from
the masked batteries, one company being almost entirely decimated. This
caused the regiment to retire to the knoll. Colonel Patrick, a most
gallant officer of the Fifth, was killed, also seventy-five of his men
killed and wounded. The loss of the Twenty-ninth Ohio in this charge
was forty killed and wounded, shot down in almost the short space of
time required to record it.

It was not long before we heard tremendous cheering in the distance on
our right front, which was caused by Sherman moving a force in that
direction, turning the rebel flank, which was soon in full retreat.
Immediately after, sounds were heard in the supposed deserted rebel
works, which we believed were our own men who had recently occupied
them, and by reason of this supposed safety our whole command was soon
in slumber deep and heavy from exhaustion of the day’s labor.

At early dawn on May 26th the enemy discovered our close proximity,
and at once opened upon us with artillery, and at about the same time
advanced its infantry to attack us in our rear. This movement was
discovered, however, in time to prevent its further progress. After
a hot fight the enemy retired to his fortifications. During the day
several attempts were made in the same direction, but without effect.
Near the close of the day we were temporarily relieved and retired to
a ravine a few yards in our rear, where we received rations, the first
“square meal” in two days.

At an early hour the following morning (May 27th) our artillery took
position at the breastworks and opened a furious cannonading, which is
replied to with spirit by the rebel batteries. During the afternoon the
enemy made a sortie on our line, a general engagement ensued, and the
rebels were beaten back. The Twenty-ninth regiment loss was slight, we
being well protected by rifle pits. The rebel loss in this attack was
severe, their dead and wounded being thickly strewn in front of our
works. During this attack General Sherman and staff took position in
our rear. General Hooker is generally where the bullets fly thickest,
and his utter disregard of danger has won the love of the “boys,” who
call him “Uncle Joe,” and who are all, at any time, ready to go through
fire if he so desires, knowing he will not ask them to go where he
fears to lead.

The battle continues throughout the following day, with brisk
infantry firing and heavy cannonading almost incessantly. As night
again shrouds the bloody field the Twenty-ninth regiment, with the
exception of company B, which was on the skirmish line, relieved the
Seventh Ohio, One Hundred and Ninth, and One Hundred and Forty-seventh
Pennsylvania. The rebels were unusually quiet during the night. Company
B remained on the skirmish nearly all of the following day and was kept
hotly engaged. The company’s position was not more than eight rods from
the rebel outposts, who made it extremely hot for us as we went back
and forth to the relief of our comrades, and sometimes unsoldierly
attitudes were assumed to evade their deadly aim. Late in the day
company B was relieved. Henry Brainard, Spencer Atkin, and Henry Clark
volunteered to go out and bring in the bodies of Albert Atkin, C. A.
Davis, and Jerome Phinney, which they did, the enemy opening fire upon
them with musketry and artillery, the deadly missiles flying thick
and fast about them. Such was the treatment of the “chivalry” to men
bravely exposing themselves to give Christian interment to the gallant
men who had fought their last battle. However, none were injured.
While performing the last sad rites of burial, the rebels came out
in a sortie and made furious assaults along our entire line. Our men
reserved their fire until the enemy were close upon them, when, at a
given signal, some twenty cannon, double shotted with grape, opened
fire, which made the earth tremble with their awful thunder, while
the infantry sent deadly volleys into their ranks. The result of this
fire was most terrible slaughter to the enemy, who broke and ran
anywhere to cover, leaving several hundred dead and dying behind, the
ground between the two lines being literally covered with the rebel
dead. During the 30th there were several sharp fights, our regiment
having several men wounded. May 31st the regiment was under fire, as
usual, the greater part of the day, and at night was engaged in the
construction of an advanced line of works, under a heavy fire from
the entire rebel line. Before they were fully completed the rebels
commenced an attack and we fell back on the main line. General Geary
being present, exclaimed, “Get back to your command in readiness for
an engagement.” One ensued, which resulted in driving the enemy back
with severe loss to them. We now resumed work and finally succeeded in
completing the line, though continually annoyed by the enemy’s firing.

On the morning of June 1st the regiment resumed its place on the front
line and was soon furiously engaged, which continued during the fore
part of the day. At noon the Twentieth corps was relieved by Logan’s
Fifteenth corps and moved to the left as support to the Fourth corps
(General Howard). The following morning we moved towards the left and
at 11 o’clock A. M. formed line and pushed forward in concert with
Schofield’s Twenty-third corps. We capture two lines of rebel works,
the enemy falling back. That night we slept on our arms. At dawn on the
3d we advanced and were soon engaged with the enemy, the skirmishing
along our whole line being very strong. During the day Sherman
succeeded in turning the rebel right, causing him to retire with severe
loss. Twenty-ninth loss: Killed, six; wounded, twenty-four; captured,
one; total thirty-one. This is the tenth day we have been under fire.
4th.--Firing during all of last night. All quiet to-day.




CHAPTER XVI.

Advance to Pine Knob--Battle at that Place--A Forward Movement.


At 5 o’clock on the morning of June 6th, the army pushed forward after
the retreating enemy. When about two miles from Ackworth Station
he makes a stand, and we wheel into line, the Twenty-ninth acting
as skirmishers while the other troops were engaged in preparing
rifle-pits. The Fourteenth corps now came up, forming on our left,
and General Howard’s Fourth corps on our right. The position remained
the same until June 10th, when the Twenty-ninth Ohio is sent forward
on a reconnoissance. A large force of rebels are found to be strongly
entrenched on Pine mountain. At dark the regiment returned to the main
line, where the situation remains unchanged until June 14th, when our
entire force move forward. The Twentieth, with the Fourth corps on
its left, take position immediately in front of the rebel army, on
Pine mountain. At evening the Twenty-ninth was again advanced to the
skirmish line, and was engaged, as was our artillery, throughout the
greater part of the night. On the following day, June 15th, occurs the
battle of Pine Knob, Georgia.

At early dawn our regiment pushed forward as the advance of a general
flank movement on Pine mountain, which resulted in its capture without
severe fighting. The Twentieth corps was changed from the front to
the right. Moving rapidly in that direction it soon reached another
strongly entrenched position of the enemy, when the column made a
left half wheel, which brought the first brigade of Geary’s division
directly in front of Pine Knob.

This position of the enemy was found to be strongly fortified. Twenty
embrazures, from which as many cannon bristled, covered all the
approaches to it. General Hooker ordered General Geary to send two
regiments in a sortie against the rebel position, and the Twenty-ninth
Ohio and Twenty-eighth Pennsylvania regiments, the latter on our left,
were at once forwarded to the assault. General Hooker, mounted on his
famous gray charger, advanced with us, immediately in rear of our line.
The general’s presence greatly encouraged the men in this desperate
undertaking.

On the hill were the twenty cannon, which we knew would soon belch
forth destruction to our ranks. The two regiments silently but rapidly
cross a ravine where they encounter two rebel regiments. These proved
to be the First and Twenty-ninth Georgia. We opened fire briskly and
charging upon them soon drove them in disorder to the rear.

We pursued them so hotly that our standard-bearer was at one time
within a few paces of the rebel Twenty-ninth Georgia colors, which we
were making desperate efforts to capture. The rebel color-bearer was
shot, but their flag was grasped again by another rebel who escaped
with it into their fortification. But the regiment to which he belonged
was nearly annihilated before it succeeded in regaining its main line.
Our regiment had rushed upon them forcing them back step by step until
they were under cover, and we had succeeded in killing, wounding,
and taking prisoners all except the little handful who escaped with
the flag. At the moment of their escape we made a dash to carry
their fortifications, but were checked by abattis and a deep trench
hidden by brush. At this point their artillery opened with murderous
discharges of grape and canister, which produced terrible destruction
in our ranks. Still the line stands firm. Another instant and our men
are laying flat upon the ground and the deadly missiles go hissing
harmlessly through the air over our heads. We now open a fire upon
their cannoniers, so deadly in its character that the guns are soon
silenced.

Night was fast coming on when our line was ordered to fall back to a
more secure position. The men now engage in the erection of earthworks
within a few rods of the rebel fort on the knob, which placed the
Twenty-ninth Ohio in the extreme front, our flanking regiments assuming
a circular position on our right and left rear. We were under fire all
night, the rebel infantry and artillery keeping up an almost continuous
rattle in their endeavors to drive our men from their labors on the
fortifications. Despite this, however, we held our position, though
suffering a constant loss in our ranks.

Just at daybreak on the 16th instant the Sixty-sixth Ohio, of our
brigade from the reserve, relieved us; we, however, left them well
protected by the strong earthworks constructed during the night.

The Twenty-ninth Ohio regiment went into this action with two hundred
members, of whom thirty-nine were killed and wounded. Among the
killed was First Sergeant Joel E. Tanner, one of our bravest men.
Soon after his death his commission reached us promoting him to a
captaincy for bravery in action. God help that little wife of his in
her far away northern home to bear his death bravely as the wife of
a soldier should, even though all her hopes and bright anticipations
seem shattered by the blow. Generals Joe Hooker and Geary announced
in warm terms their admiration of the “gallant manner in which the
Twenty-ninth Ohio and Twenty-eighth Pennsylvania regiments conducted
themselves in the assault on Pine Knob.” The former remarked that
taking into consideration the deadly fire we were exposed to, we had
accomplished that which he never saw so small a force attempt before.
As he was present in the assault his opinion is of value.

Sharp skirmishing and artillery firing continued along the line during
the day. At night the Twenty-ninth regiment moved to the front,
relieving the Sixty-sixth Ohio regiment. It was nearly morning when we
discovered that the enemy were withdrawing their artillery. We at once
advanced and possessed the rebel fortifications on the hill with little
trouble, as the artillery had already withdrawn and the infantry were
rapidly following. After daylight we pushed forward, only to find the
enemy in another strong position, which we at once attacked. A rambling
fire was kept up during the entire day.

During the following day (June 18th) the same state of affairs
continued, the firing extending along our entire front. At an early
hour next morning the enemy retreated, and we moved in pursuit, the
Twenty-ninth Ohio regiment, as usual, in the advance as skirmishers.
Why, I believe the “boys” would have rebelled had they not been put
on the skirmish line whenever there was a prospect of somebody being
killed on our side. Rapidly we gained possession of two lines of hills,
and soon found the enemy upon a third ridge, strongly fortified. A
skirmish of two hours’ duration ensues, and we are ordered to fall back
to the main line, as support to Bundy’s Thirteenth New York battery.

June 20th the Twenty-ninth regiment and its brigade are in line three
miles southwest of Marietta, Georgia, and skirmished all day with the
enemy. As night came on our division moved to the right, forming on the
right of Butterfield’s Third division. Our regiment was again on the
skirmish line, and in active engagement during the greater part of the
night. The next morning we formed line of battle near Culp’s farm and
to the right of Little Kenesaw mountain. At about 11 A. M. our regiment
was withdrawn from the skirmish line, and at once began throwing up
rifle-pits parallel with works of Williams’ First division on our right
and Butterfield’s on our left. The Third brigade of the Second division
now advanced and engaged the enemy, our single line affording feeble
protection in the event of an attack on our position.




CHAPTER XVII.

Battle of Culp’s Farm or Kenesaw Mountain--The Glorious Fourth--Advance
to the Chattahoochie.


June 22d we move to the front, and occupy a ridge on Culp’s farm, which
covers the level on our front. We had been but a short time in this
position when the rebel General Hood’s corps was moved directly on our
front, and immediately advanced in furious attack upon the divisions of
Generals Geary and Williams. Our artillery was at once turned upon the
advancing rebel columns, which, with the terrific volleys our infantry
poured into their ranks, produced a sudden check to their further
advance, and in less than one hour these two divisions succeeded in
beating back and putting to total rout Hood’s entire command, which
suffered great loss, while ours was but slight. The enemy left on the
field 2,100 killed, wounded, and prisoners, besides many wounded,
removed from the field. The estimated rebel loss was 3,000 men. Eight
hundred of the rebel dead were buried on the field.

At the close of this action a body of our skirmishers were deployed
over the field, finding the enemy’s dead and wounded scattered thickly
about. In places they lay stretched across each other, literally heaped
up, bloody, terrible--dead. Our skirmishers advanced rapidly, and
were soon engaged with the enemy’s rear, but this soon ceased, and we
established a picket line for the night. We remained on the field until
noon of the 23d, when we were retired and rejoined the main line.

At about 4 o’clock P. M., one hundred guns opened a simultaneous
fire on Little Kenesaw mountain. Directly in front of our regiment
and across the creek, which flows along the base of the mountain, is
level ground. At this point is situated a block-house and rifle-pits,
the latter between the house and mountain, and both now held by rebel
sharpshooters, who were continually picking off our cannoniers. General
Geary, evidently contemplating an advance of his line, called for
twenty volunteers from the Twenty-ninth regiment to dislodge these
troublesome occupants of the block-house and rifle-pits. In response to
this call two men from each company came quickly forward, and at once
advanced across the creek and ravine. The rebels soon discovered the
detachment; and opened fire upon it. Sergeant Griswold, of Company B,
in command, rapidly advanced his men up the rise of open ground lying
between him and the enemy, and with a rush amidst a perfect storm of
bullets, closed on the rifle-pits, capturing all who remained in them.

We now approach the rear of the block-house and demand its surrender.
The rebel lieutenant in command exclaimed from the window of the house:
“You d--d yanks, take us if you can!” and immediately opened fire.
The door of the house is soon battered down, and the rebels attempt
to cut their way out. Finding themselves covered by nearly a score of
rifles, aimed by determined men, all, with the exception of the rebel
lieutenant and one other, threw down their arms and surrendered. The
rebel officer fired on the captors and lost his life by his rashness.
We had now a total of twenty-one prisoners. Several others were killed
or badly wounded. The former were sent at once to the rear, and the
little force deployed along the road to hold the position until
reinforcements should arrive. However, they were not furnished, and
after holding the position some two hours a heavy body of rebels came
upon us, stealing along under cover of the bushes on the opposite side
of the road, suddenly arose and fired a volley at us. The speed we made
across the level field with the rebels in hot pursuit, their bullets
whistling past our ears in the most energetic manner, would have
dismayed a professional pedestrian.

June 24th, skirmishing during the day. As night came on a detachment
of the Twenty-ninth regiment was sent out on picket. Nothing occurred
during the night, and at dawn we returned to our brigade, where orders
were received to hold ourselves in readiness to move on notice,
cannonading and skirmish fighting being kept up along the line.

The situation remained unchanged until June 27th. At an early hour
this morning two men from each company of our regiment volunteered to
advance to the relief of the Pennsylvania regiment on the outposts,
and about 9 o’clock A. M. we moved forward. We were also to dislodge
the rebel sharpshooters, who had been allowed to again possess the
block-house and rifle-pits. Crossing the creek and ravine we made a
quick dash toward the locality mentioned, amid a hot cross-fire from
rebels along the fence before referred to. But as we close the rebels
abandon the block-house and rifle-pits, yet dispute with the energy of
desperation, every inch of our advance as they retire. We, however,
gained possession of the road beyond the house, an important position
covering the rebel left on Little Kenesaw.

They now opened fire on us from the mountain on our left and front.
Making a flank movement to the left we came up in rear of some rebel
rifle-pits, capturing eleven prisoners and holding the position until
the Fifth Ohio regiment came to our support. That regiment at once
began to fortify, while we remained on the skirmish line under constant
fire. The enemy discovered the work of the Fifth and trained their
batteries from different directions on our position, and also advanced
infantry, who made repeated attempts to dislodge us. Solid shot and
shell came crashing through the block-house, the shells bursting
amongst us in quick succession. Nor were their musketry behind in
sending their death-dealing missiles upon us.

Knapp’s battery soon came up the hill, and swinging into position,
unlimbered and opened a rapid cross-fire on Little Kenesaw mountain.
About this time the Fourteenth, with a portion of the Fourth corps,
made a desperate assault on the mountain a short distance to our left.
The engagement now became serious, one shell killing twelve and another
six of our men. To hold the position we had captured was an arduous
undertaking, and so severe was the fighting that those of us who had
advanced early in the morning had fired nearly two hundred rounds. At
dusk the fighting ceased, and we are recalled to our command.

June 28th.--This morning at sunrise we advance obliquely to the right,
and, reaching an advanced position, throw up fortifications; rebel
batteries open fire on us meanwhile. Our lookout, as he sees smoke
issue from the rebel guns, calls out: “Lay down,” “lay low,” or “look
out, she’s coming,” etc. Many laughable and other incidents occurred
during this bombardment, such as attempts to dodge shells, etc. Charles
Upton, of Company G, while carrying a rail, had it cut in two by a
shell; he, however, escaped unhurt.

June 29th.--To-day the Fourteenth corps obtained a temporary truce
under flag, during which they interred their dead. An assault is made
on this corps during the early part of the night, but is repulsed, and
we were not again disturbed.

June 30th.--During this afternoon the Twenty-ninth regiment received
orders to move. About 10 o’clock at night our corps (the Twentieth) was
relieved by the Fourteenth. We at once marched several miles to the
right in relief of the Twenty-third corps.

On July 1st our regiment was again engaged. The fighting ceased only
with daylight. Sharp skirmishing and severe cannonading continued
during the entire day of the 2d, and at night the Twenty-ninth regiment
occupied its customary position--on the skirmish line. This time,
however, it was accompanied by the Twenty-eighth Pennsylvania. Just
before daylight on the morning of July 3d, the enemy were found to be
retreating, and we at once moved forward to find the works deserted,
the troops having evacuated. The position, as supposed, was almost
impregnable to direct assault, being constructed to enfilade an attack
of infantry.

The army now push forward in pursuit of the retreating rebels, the
Twenty-ninth Ohio and Twenty-eighth Pennsylvania taking the advance
in the order of heavy skirmishers. We soon came upon Wheeler’s
rebel cavalry, and engaged his dismounted men so promptly that they
fell precipitately back to where their horses were picketed. The
Twenty-ninth succeeded in capturing nearly one hundred of them in their
hurried efforts to remount. The Second division during the pursuit
captured nearly nine hundred prisoners. The rebels were steadily
falling back on the Chattahoochie river. It was late when we halted
for the night. How sweet the wooing of the drowsy god after such long
continued fatigue, only those who have been there can imagine, the soft
side of a rail on such occasions being more luxurious than any patent
spring contrivance of to-day.

July 4th. On this day, made glorious to all this goodly land by the
forefathers of both the blue and gray, was celebrated by the issue of
full rations of hard-tack, s----, bacon, and coffee, and wonderful
feats of gormandizing ensued. To make the day something of a reminder
of the Northern anniversary, with its tearing headache of the 5th,
General “Joe” ordered an issue of liquor to the men, the first of the
campaign. About 4 o’clock P. M. we broke camp and marched towards the
left, but soon came to a halt for the night.

At dawn on the following day we pushed forward and took possession of a
line of works the rebels had only evacuated on our approach. They are
now crossing Chattahoochie river. The advance is continued until within
about one and one-half miles of the river, where we encounter a second
line of rebel works, occupied by the enemy to cover the retreat across
the river.

July 6th we occupy the position of yesterday. During the forenoon our
regiment was support of Bundy’s New York battery, engaged in shelling
the rebels from a fort. About 2 P. M. we returned with the battery to
the main line, and one hour later moved with our division to the left
and formed line of battle, in which position we passed the night. On
the day following we marched to the left and assumed position in line
between the Fourteenth and Fifteenth corps. Sharp skirmishing was kept
up nearly all night. This position is maintained by our regiment,
with daily skirmishing, until the early dawn of July 10th, when the
Twenty-ninth Ohio is pushed forward on a reconnoissance. We discover
that the enemy have retreated across the Chattahoochie. On reaching
the river we deploy as skirmishers along the north bank, the enemy
being posted along the opposite side. Atlanta lies only nine miles to
the south of us. The rebel army of General Joe E. Johnston is said to
be strongly intrenched some four miles south of our position. A small
number only of rebels remain on the opposite bank of the Chattahoochie.
The Union and rebel pickets are on good terms, often meeting in the
middle of the river, where they exchange coffee for tobacco, which,
by the way, was a very scarce article with us. The Twenty-ninth Ohio
regiment now musters only one hundred and fifty men for duty. The
mustering officer tells us that we have lost more men killed and
wounded in proportion to the number present at the beginning of this
campaign than any regiment in the Western army.

July 6, we were in support of a battery during the forenoon. During the
afternoon we moved to the left, camping in a beautiful grove of pines.

7th. Moved forward some three miles, to a ridge commanding a fine view
of the country.

11th. The rebels have crossed Chattahoochie river. Our pickets are
posted on its north bank.

17th. Moved forward to the left, crossed the Chattahoochie river at
Peace ferry about 9 o’clock P. M.

18th. Moved forward some two miles, skirmishing much of the distance.

19th. Advanced to Peach Tree creek, which we crossed, encountering the
enemy and taking some prisoners.




CHAPTER XVIII.

Battle of Peach Tree Creek--Some of the “boys” go to Andersonville.


On the morning of July 20th, just as old Sol was tinting the east with
his rosy hue, our army began a general forward movement, the Twentieth
corps in this advance being on the right centre, the Fourth corps left,
resting on our right, and Newton’s division (Fourth corps) connecting
with our left. Slight skirmishing ensued early in the morning, but
towards noon the enemy retired. The unbroken stillness which followed
caused us to advance cautiously lest the rebels draw us into an ambush.
On reaching Peach Tree creek, a narrow, sluggish stream, whose abrupt
banks, covered with briars and a dense, almost impassable undergrowth,
would be a fatal barrier to a routed army, especially as the stream
was without bridges, the entire command came to a halt until crossings
could be constructed. Previous to the crossing of the main line General
Geary ordered forward a force in reconnoissance, consisting of the
Twenty-ninth Ohio, Twenty-eighth Pennsylvania, a detachment of the
Thirty-third New Jersey, and four pieces of Bundy’s New York battery,
Geary himself following and directing the movement. When once across
we advanced over several rough sparsely wooded ravines until reaching
an eminence overlooking a narrow, open valley on our front and left.
Immediately on our right front was a piece of heavy timber, extending
also on our rear. The ridge directly in our front was covered with
a thick undergrowth, affording a fine position for an ambuscade.
Our force was now brought to a halt. Bundy’s battery was hastily put
into position on the ridge to cover the valley. The Twenty-ninth Ohio
assumed position on the right, and the Twenty-eighth Pennsylvania on
the left of the battery. D. E. Hurlburt, captain of company K, had
charge of a detail from the Twenty-ninth and Sixty-sixth Ohio regiments
in the skirmish of the timber, so he states.

The detachment of the Thirty-third New Jersey deployed as skirmishers
across the valley in our front, General Geary and staff following
closely in its rear. While they were advancing, we hastily constructed
a light barricade of fence rails, and Bundy prepared his battery for
business. We anxiously watched General Geary and the skirmishers as
they cautiously moved up the ridge.

When within a few yards of the underbrush a large force of rebels
came from cover, and with wild yells rushed forward. Captain Bundy at
once opened fire upon them, which threw them into disorder, but did
not check their advance. As Geary and staff passed over our line his
chief, Captain Elliott, fell from his horse, shot dead. Geary shouted
to us, “A general engagement! a general engagement! My brave men hold
to your position. I will send support to you.” He was answered with
rousing cheers. When the little remnant of the skirmishing force had
come in we commenced a rapid fire in connection with Captain Bundy’s
double-shotted guns, which speedily thinned the advancing columns of
rebels, but without avail, as the breaks were at once filled with
fresh troops. As the rebels attempted to close with us our men seemed
to be endowed with the valor born of desperation, and clubbed them
back. Forward they came, a dense mass of living fire, and bravely we
sustained the shock of twenty times our number. The sharp rattle of
musketry, the loud roar of Bundy’s guns, and the defiant shouts of the
combatants, in close hand to hand conflict, can never be erased from
the tablets of memory while life shall last. It was grandly, awfully
terrible.

A dense smoke settled around the battery and enclosing the extreme left
of the regiment, hid the position of our right. Suddenly firing begins
on us from our rear. The cannoniers are disabled and the infantry are
called upon to work the guns, which were instantly turned to the rear
upon heavy masses of rebels advancing from the woods on our flank.
The greater part of our regiment had discovered this movement in
time to change front to rear, but were instantly forced back by the
overwhelming numbers of the rebels, and those in charge of the battery
were instantly surrounded by a powerful mob of yelling fiends. Still
the double-shotted guns continue to belch forth fire and death, cutting
great gaps in the ranks of the enemy at each discharge.

At the guns’ front, with muskets clubbed, a hand to hand conflict was
had, to allow the reloading of the guns. The situation was now most
desperate. A cordon of the enemy hemmed in the brave band, now reduced
to but seventy men, whose ammunition was exhausted, and at last they
were forced to surrender the battery. Henry Rood, of company A, and
Henry E. Clark, company B, are the only names the writer has been able
to secure of those captured at this time.

General Geary came up soon after, charged the enemy and recovered the
battery, which was instantly turned upon the rebels, causing great
destruction. The prisoners were, however, too far in the rear for
recapture, and they were conveyed to that loathsome earthly hell,
Andersonville. What they endured, the cruelties of the studied
starvation by express order of chivalric Jeff Davis, and the horrible
atrocities accorded to defenseless prisoners by the Southern opponents
in this unholy, ungodly conflict, the writer will not attempt to
describe; language fails in the recital. Loss: Killed, two; wounded,
seven; captured, five; total fourteen.




CHAPTER XIX.

Siege of Atlanta--The Capitulation--General Sherman’s Report.


July 21st, heavy skirmishing on our right. 22d, we moved forward in
pursuit of the retreating rebels. 23d, we are now strongly intrenched,
within two miles of Atlanta, Georgia; lively skirmishing much of the
time. 24th, shelling and picket firing to-day; rebels charged our line
but were repulsed. 25th, brisk firing all day. 26th, advanced our line
forty rods. 27th, quiet along the lines. 28th, heavy firing on our
right; the rebels are repulsed. 29th and 30th, fighting continues.

August 1st to 3d, hot firing all the time. 4th, National Thanksgiving
Day; fighting on our right; rebels driven back; skirmishing every
day--all the time; getting monotonous. 25th, left our works and
fell back to the Chattahoochie river, near Vining station; marched
all night. 27th, Major-general W. H. Slocum assumed command of the
Twentieth army corps.

September 4th, moved forward to Atlanta, which we reached about 2
o’clock P. M.; marched through the city and went into camp about one and
one-half miles west of the city. 6th, received an order from General
Sherman that the campaign was ended, and that the troops are to have
a full month’s rest; that our task was not only done, but well done.
12th, the citizens of Atlanta were moved south to-day; from this date
we lay in camp with little to mar our happiness till November 1st,
when we received orders to send all our baggage to the rear and put
ourselves in light marching order. November 5th, orders having been
received for the troops to move, the Twenty-ninth struck tents and
marched from Atlanta at 3:30 P. M. in the direction of Stone Mountain,
some three miles, and camped for the night. At 1 o’clock P. M. on the
following day, the regiment marched back to Atlanta, and again occupied
its old camp.

During the afternoon of the 1st of September specific orders for the
withdrawal of Stewart’s rebel _corps de armee_ and the militia were
issued, and about sunset the latter were withdrawn from the trenches.
When they were fairly on the road Stewart’s corps followed, all being
en route by midnight, except the cavalry, a brigade or two of infantry,
and the pickets. These latter remained until the advance of the
Twentieth corps neared the city on the morning of the 2d. The explosion
of ammunition was of course heard at the position of the Twentieth
corps, and though General Slocum (who it appears was in command of the
Twentieth corps at the time) had received no intelligence of Sherman’s
great success at Jonesboro, he was not unprepared to find Hood gone
any morning, and the explosions convinced him that the withdrawal was
taking place. He instantly issued orders to his division commanders,
Generals Ward, Williams, and Geary, to send out each a heavy
reconnoissance at daybreak on the morning of the 2d.

About 1,000 men were detailed from each division, and at 5 A. M. pushed
forward on neighboring roads into Atlanta on the north and northwest,
encountering no opposition. They pushed rapidly forward, and at 8
o’clock came in sight of the rebel intrenchments, so lately occupied
with enemies but now silent and deserted.

Advancing rapidly, Colonel Coburn, commanding General Ward’s
reconnoissance, entered the enemy’s works, encountering in the
suburbs Mayor Calhoun, of Atlanta, and a deputation of the city
council. The former nervously presented a paper surrendering the city
and asking protection. Colonel Coburn refused to receive the paper
for informality, and directed that another should be drawn up. Mayor
Calhoun invited several of General Ward’s staff to accompany him
to the court-house, where the documents should be made _en regle_,
promising at the same time to expel the drunken rebel stragglers,
who were lingering in the streets and were disposed to skirmish with
our advance. He immediately took measures to effect the last, and
accompanied by the officers whose names are offered in attest, he
returned to the court-house, and the following document was drawn up:

  “ATLANTA, GEORGIA, }
  September 2, 1864. }

  “Brigadier-general Ward, Commanding Third Division
  Twentieth Corps.

 “SIR:--The fortunes of war have placed the city of Atlanta in your
 hands, and as mayor of the city I ask protection to non-combatants and
 private property.

  “JAMES M. CALHOUN,
  Mayor of Atlanta.”

The preliminary formalities thus disposed of, our troops entered
the city with music and flags, marching promptly and erect. A fine
flag-staff was found on the Franklin printing house, where the Memphis
Appeal had been printed. The stars and stripes were soon flung to the
calm, sunny air amid the cheers of the brave men who had fought for so
many weary, consuming days to place it there.

General Henry W. Slocum established his headquarters at the Trout
house, the leading hotel of the city, overlooking the public square.
In the forts around Atlanta eleven heavy guns, mainly sixty-four
pounders, were left by the enemy; also about three thousand muskets, in
good order, stored in various parts of the city, were found; also three
locomotives in running order, and large quantities of manufactured
tobacco were discovered. Between one and two hundred stragglers, the
majority of them very drunk, were fished from their hiding places and
placed under guard at the court-house.

 GENERAL THOMAS’ CONGRATULATORY ORDER.

  ARMY HEADQUARTERS, July 26, 1864.

 “The major-general commanding the army congratulates the troops upon
 the brilliant success attending the Union arms in the late battles.
 In the battle of the 20th instant, in which the Twentieth corps, one
 division of the Fourth corps, and part of the Fourteenth corps were
 engaged, the total union loss in killed, wounded, and missing was
 1,733. In front of the Twentieth corps there were put out of the fight
 6,000 rebels; 563 of the enemy were buried by our own troops, and the
 rebels were permitted to bury 250. The Second division of the Fourth
 corps repulsed seven different assaults of the enemy with light loss
 to themselves, and which must have swelled the number of dead buried
 by the rebels to beyond 300. We also captured seven stands of colors.
 No official report has been received of the part taken in the battle
 by the Fourteenth corps. In the battle of the 22d instant, the total
 Union loss in killed, wounded, and missing was 3,500, and also 10
 pieces of artillery. The rebel loss in prisoners captured was 3,200.
 The known dead of the enemy in front of the Fifteenth and Sixteenth
 corps and one division of the Seventeenth corps was 2,142. The other
 divisions of the Seventeenth corps repulsed six assaults of the enemy
 before they fell back, and which will swell the rebel loss in killed
 to at least 3,000. The latest reports state that we buried over 3,200
 rebels killed in this fight. There were captured from the enemy in
 this battle 18 stands of colors and 5,000 stands of arms.

  “By command of
  MAJOR-GENERAL GEORGE H. THOMAS.

  “W. D. WHIPPLE,
  Assistant Adjutant-general.”

 GENERAL SHERMAN’S SPECIAL FIELD ORDER NO. 68.

  “HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION, OF THE }
  MISSISSIPPI IN THE FIELD,               }
  ATLANTA, GEORGIA, SEPT. 8, 1864.        }

 “The officers and soldiers of the armies of the Cumberland, Ohio, and
 Tennessee have already received the thanks of the Nation through its
 President and commander in chief, and it remains now only for him
 who has been with you from the beginning, and who intends to stay
 all the time, to thank the officers and men for their intelligence,
 fidelity, and courage displayed in the campaign of Atlanta. On the
 1st day of May our armies were lying in garrison, seemingly quiet,
 from Knoxville to Huntsville, and our enemy lay behind his rocky-faced
 barrier at Dalton, proud, defiant, and exultant. He had time since
 Christmas to recover from his discomfiture on the Mission Ridge, with
 his ranks filled, and a new commander in chief, second to none of the
 Confederacy in reputation for skill, sagacity, and extreme popularity.
 All at once our armies assumed life and action and appeared before
 Dalton. Threatening Rocky Face, we threw ourselves upon Resaca, and
 the rebel army only escaped by the rapidity of its retreat, aided by
 the numerous roads with which he was familiar, and which were strange
 to us. Again he took post, at Allatoona, but we gave him no rest, and
 by a circuit toward Dallas and a subsequent movement to Ackworth, we
 gained the Allatoona pass. Then followed the eventful battles about
 Kenesaw and the escape of the enemy across the Chattahoochie river.
 The crossing of the Chattahoochie and breaking of the Augusta road
 was most handsomely executed by us, and will be studied as an example
 in the art of war. At this stage of our game our enemies became
 dissatisfied with their old and skilful commander and selected one
 more bold and rash. New tactics were adopted. Hood first boldly and
 rapidly on the 20th of July fell on our right at Peach Tree creek, and
 lost again. On the 22d he struck our extreme left and was severely
 punished; and finally again on the 28th he repeated the attempt on our
 right, and that time must have been satisfied, for since that date he
 has remained on the defensive. We slowly and gradually drew our lines
 about Atlanta, feeling for the railroads which supplied the rebel army
 and made Atlanta a place of importance. We must concede to our enemy
 that he met these efforts patiently and skilfully, but at last he made
 the mistake we had waited for so long and sent his cavalry to our
 rear, far beyond the reach of recall. Instantly our cavalry was on his
 only remaining road, and we followed quickly with our principal army,
 and Atlanta fell into our possession as the fruit of well-concerted
 measures, backed by a brave and competent army. This completed the
 grand task which had been assigned us by our Government, and your
 general again repeats his personal and official thanks to all the
 officers and men composing this army for the indomitable courage and
 perseverance which alone could give success. We have beaten our enemy
 on every ground he has chosen, and have wrested from him his own
 Gate city, where were located his foundries, arsenals, and workshops,
 deemed secure on account of their distance from our base and the
 seeming impregnable obstacles intervening. Nothing is impossible to an
 army like this, determined to vindicate a government wherever our flag
 has once floated, and resolved to maintain them at any and all cost.

 “In our campaign many, yea very many of our noble and gallant comrades
 have preceded us to our common destination, the grave; but they have
 left the memory of deeds on which a Nation can build a proud history.
 McPherson, Harker, McCook, and others dear to us all, are now the
 binding links in our minds that should attach more closely together
 the living, who have to complete the task which still lies before us
 in the dim future.

 “I ask all to continue as they have so well begun, the cultivation
 of the soldierly virtues that have ennobled our own and other
 countries,--courage, patience, obedience to the laws and constituted
 authorities of our Government, fidelity to our trusts, and good
 feeling among each other; each trying to excel the other in the
 practice of those high qualities, and it will then require no prophet
 to foretell that our country will, in time, emerge from this war
 purified by the fires of war and worthy its great founder, Washington.

  “W. T. SHERMAN,
  Major-general commanding.”




CHAPTER XX.

With Sherman to the Sea--Colonel Schoonover’s Journal--Siege of
Savannah.


Tuesday, the 8th instant, the Twenty-ninth was very busy holding
election. Detachments from other organizations were permitted to vote
at the Twenty-ninth headquarters. The Twenty-ninth regiment cast three
hundred and eighty-four votes. Of these Lincoln received three hundred
and fifty and McClellan thirty-four. During the day the regiment was
wide awake and enthusiastic, and gave every soldier a chance to vote.
At 6:30 A. M. on the following day, while the regiment was in tents
eating breakfast, the rebels opened a lively fire with artillery, at
short range. The enemy approached our picket, which was posted west
of camp, covering the Sandtown road, who were surprised and fell back
without firing a shot; hence the first intimation that we had that the
enemy was near was the report of their artillery and the bursting of
shells in our midst. The Twenty-ninth fell in and took position behind
the fortification which the regiment had constructed. In the meantime a
line of skirmishers was sent out and soon the enemy were driven back. A
portion of the brigade was sent out on the Sandtown road, marched a few
miles, but the Confederates had flown, and late in the afternoon the
scouting party returned to camp.

November 10th. Remained in camp occupied in the usual camp and picket
duties, and the inspection of ammunition, arms, and accoutrements, and
all was quiet, and at 8 o’clock in the evening the city of Atlanta
took fire and was nearly annihilated. Saturday, the 12th, in camp, and
all is quiet. Sunday, November 13th, the Twenty-ninth was detailed to
tear up and destroy the railroad, and 7:30 marched out on the railroad
leading to Chattanooga, and was engaged until 10 at night in burning
the ties and bending the rails. At night the regiment returned to its
old camp at Atlanta. 14th instant, in camp; all quiet. A man in company
I was injured by falling from a building. 15th instant, marched at 6:30
A. M. on the road leading to Stone mountain in a southeast direction
from Atlanta, and at 6 P. M. halted and went into camp (marched fifteen
miles). 16th instant, marched at 7:30 A. M., and at 5:15 P. M. halted
and camped for the night (marched twelve miles). 17th instant, marched
at 5 o’clock A. M., and after marching twelve miles halted for dinner,
and at 2 P. M. fell in and marched until 5 P. M., when the regiment
halted and went into camp. 18th instant, moved at 4:30 A. M.; marched
ten miles, and at 12 M. halted for dinner; fell in at 1 o’clock and at
6 P. M. halted and camped for the night (marched twenty miles during
the day). 19th instant, marched at 6:30 A. M.

Twentieth instant, moved fourteen miles and camped for the night
near Edenton. 21st, marched through Edenton in the direction of
Milledgeville, a distance of sixteen miles, and went into camp. 22d,
marched at 5:30 A. M., halted at 12 M. one hour for dinner, and at
1:15 P. M. fell in and marched until 8 o’clock P. M., passed through
Milledgeville and crossed the Oconee river and camped for the night.
23d, Twenty-ninth regiment detailed for picket; fell in and moved east
about three-fourths of a mile, passing through the woods and advancing
into an open country; during its stay on picket duty some of the
boys went out on a foraging expedition, and it is not necessary to
state that they were successful, and that honey, sweet potatoes, and
some fine chickens (which the quartermaster had left), made a very
pleasant repast. 24th, received orders to join the brigade; marched at
7 o’clock A. M., and halted at 1:30 for dinner; fell in at 2:15 P. M.,
halted at 7:30, camped for the night; marched fifteen miles. 25th,
moved at 7 A. M., passing through a low country covered with heavy
timber and thick undergrowth; the Twenty-ninth was train guard; halted
at 12 M., at Buffalo creek, for dinner; found the bridge destroyed;
parked the train, and late in the afternoon the bridge was repaired
and the regiment with the train crossed, passed through Buffalo swamp
and camped for the night; marched twelve miles. 26th, the regiment was
ordered up at 3:30 A. M., remained on arms until 7:30, when it marched
with the brigade; halted at 1:30 P. M. at Sandersville for dinner, and
in the afternoon marched to the Georgia Central railroad, tore up
about two miles of track, and at 8:30 went into camp; drew rations of
honey for supper. 27th, marched at 5 A. M., reached the railroad at
8:50, tore up the track, and at 2:30 P. M. marched to Davisboro, which
it reached at 9 o’clock, and camped here; marched nine miles. 28th,
in the forenoon marched back to the railroad, and tore up track until
5 o’clock P. M., then marched back to Davisboro, and camped for the
night; nothing special transpired during the night except the burning
of a house, which accidentally (?) took fire; search was made in the
regiments of the brigade by the staff officers to find out if possible
the cause of the fire, but “not guilty” was the response. 29th, marched
at 6:30 A. M., halted at 11:30, at Bartlows station, for dinner, and in
the afternoon marched through Bostwick and went into camp; marched 14
miles. 30th, marched at 6 A. M., halted at Daniel Blake’s plantation
for dinner, and in the afternoon marched four miles and camped for the
night.

December 1, 1864, marched at 7:30 A. M., the Second division in the
advance, passed through a low, wet country, almost impassable to the
ordnance train; halted at 8:15 and camped for the night; marched
fifteen miles. 2d, marched at 6 A. M., First brigade in advance; moved
about ten miles; halted at 12 M. for dinner, at a creek where the
rebels had destroyed the bridge, and while preparing dinner, the
Twenty-ninth regiment was ordered to fall in, which it did without
delay, and marched to the creek; the enemy was found on its opposite
bank in considerable force; the regiment was ordered to drive the enemy
out of the timber, force them back and hold them while the bridge was
being rebuilt; we loaded our guns, and crossing the bank four companies
under Captain Schoonover advanced to the right up the road, through the
timber (which was a thick undergrowth) driving the enemy out of the
woods and into an open field about one mile from the bridge; barricaded
the road with rails, and the other six companies under Major Wright,
advanced direct to the point through the woods about one mile, the
enemy falling back; the regiment held its position until the bridge
was rebuilt, and a crossing effected, and late in the P. M. the brigade
moved through the swamp and camped for the night. 3d, remained in camp
until after dinner, then moved forward the remainder of the day and
all night; had no supper; halted at 7 A. M. for breakfast, near Millen;
the old stockade was empty, the prisoners having been removed the day
before; after breakfast on the 4th, we moved forward, marched all day,
and at 8 P. M. halted and camped for the night. 5th, marched at 7 A. M.,
halted at 2:30 P. M. for dinner; moved three miles in the afternoon, and
at 6 went into camp for the night. 6th, marched ten miles and camped
for the night. 7th, marched at 7 A. M., halted at 12:30 for dinner;
rained all the forenoon, had no dinner; marched in the afternoon,
halted at 7 P. M. and camped for the night, near Springfield; marched
twelve miles. 8th, marched at 6:30 A. M. and camped at 4:30 P. M. near
Eden.

9th instant at 9 A. M., moved six miles and halted thirty minutes for
dinner at Wallhower Swamp, where the Confederates were found in force.
The fallen timber which obstructed the road was soon removed by the
Pioneer corps, and in the meantime with the Third brigade, of Geary’s
division in the advance, had a sharp skirmish with the rebels. While
the road was being cleared the Second division were resting on their
arms, except the Third brigade, which had advanced nearly through the
swamp. While engaged with the enemy the train was ordered forward,
and the Twenty-ninth regiment advanced on double-quick in support
of the brigade thus engaged. Passing the train it reached the Third
brigade, which had advanced about one mile and a half. The Twenty-ninth
immediately formed line on the left of the road in rear of the Third
brigade, and skirmished until dark, when the firing ceased. During the
night the rebels fell back. 10th instant, moved at 7 A. M. and marched
through the swamp where we found small earth works and two small field
pieces masked to cover the road through the swamp, but when the boys in
blue were discovered the rebels moved to the rear. The regiment marched
thirteen miles with some skirmishing and artillery firing during the
day and night.

When about four miles from the city of Savannah, Georgia, rebel
artillery was found to be in the road behind earthworks to impede our
progress. The Twenty-ninth regiment, with the brigade, filed to the
left of the road and took position in the timber, where it bivouacked
for the night. After leaving Atlanta, Georgia, on the 15th day of
November, 1864, the army was designated as the Army of Georgia, the
Twelfth and Fourteenth corps, known as the left wing, commanded by
Major-general H. W. Slocum, and the Fifteenth and Seventeenth corps,
known as the right wing, commanded by Major-general O. O. Howard,
Major-general William T. Sherman in command of the Army of Georgia.

On this march the army cut loose from the base of supplies at Atlanta,
and lived mostly from forage on the country. On reaching the enemy
within four miles of Savannah, on the 10th day of December, the
division had accumulated several hundred head of cattle. Sunday,
December 11th, moved in the morning about one mile, and took a position
near the rebel lines, the Twenty-ninth regiment, on the extreme left
of the line, with its left reaching the Savannah river. While in this
position the rebels opened fire with artillery from a fort immediately
in our front, and the infantry from their strong line of works, kept
up a continual fire. The brigade remained in line until late in the
afternoon, sustaining slight loss, when it fell back through the open
field into the woods and laid on arms all night. On the 12th inst., at
2:30 A. M., fell in and advanced to the front about one-half mile to the
old levee, and thence filed to the left. Marched about three-fourths
of a mile, halted, and prepared to charge the rebels. To do so the
right had to pass a dike or canal with four or five feet of water,
and assault the fort and breastworks in open field. The charge was
abandoned, and at 4:30 A. M. the regiment returned to camp, where we
remained skirmishing and artillery firing during the day. On the 13th
inst. the Twenty-ninth was on skirmish line all day. During the night
we advanced our line through a woods, which was heavy pine, mixed with
live oak, within two hundred yards of the rebel line, where they were
strongly intrenched. Between the contending armies was no timber except
scattering undergrowth, and a canal near the rebel line of works. In
this advanced position the regiment dug rifle-pits, which were strongly
barricaded with timber.

In the lines of rifle-pits our pickets were stationed and performed
the duty of skirmishers, being relieved every twenty-four hours, which
was done under cover of night. In the meantime the regiment fell back
about one-fourth of a mile, and constructed works of heavy timber, in
the rear of which the men put up their shelter tents. Here they could
partake of the scanty rations (but dare not sleep), as the artillery
firing and skirmishing was kept up continually day and night on the
14th, 15th, 16th and 17th; and Sunday, the 18th, skirmishing and
artillery duelling all along the line. On the 19th skirmishing all day.
In the evening a detail was made from our brigade under the command
of Major Myron T. Wright, to construct new lines of works. While
engaged in the work at 7 o’clock P. M., he received a severe wound in
the left foot (at which time Captain Jonas Schoonover took command),
the ball entering the foot a little below the instep, and lodged into
the center of the heel about one inch from the bottom of the foot. On
the 20th, firing all along the line. This ceased at 11 o’clock P. M.
The Twenty-ninth regiment, with its brigade and division, has been in
position on the left of the road leading from Springfield to the city
of Savannah, with its main line in the timber, its right resting on the
river. During the ten days the command remained in front of Savannah
it took charge of large rice mills on the river, and supplied the men
with rice. The quartermaster used large quantities for the train teams.
At one time rice sold for fifty cents per quart (before the capture
of Fort McAllister, on December 13th, 1864). The rebels in our front
were behind a heavy line of works, which was surmounted with large
timber called head logs, with port holes in their front. At their rear
was a large body of timber, their right rested on the river, where
they had constructed two forts, one near the river, and the other a
short distance west along their line, where they had a strong position
behind sand bags. But our lines were advancing nearer every day, and
during the night of December 20th they evacuated their works, and
fell back to Savannah, crossing the river into South Carolina. At 4
A. M., on the 21st day of December, the Twenty-ninth fell in, and moved
in the advance of the brigade to the front. Passing the rifle-pits,
it filed to the left, across the canal near the rebel fort, finding
their works and entire line evacuated. We moved on in the direction of
Savannah. On reaching the city, the Twenty-ninth Ohio and Twenty-eighth
Pennsylvania regiments moved down the river to Fort Jackson, which
had been evacuated and set on fire. The regiments reached the fort at
9 A. M., and at 12 o’clock at night the rebels blew up their gunboat
Beauregard. We remained at the fort until December 24th, with the usual
routine of camp and garrison duty. In the meantime the Twenty-ninth
took an inventory of the ordnance and ordnance stores captured by
the Twenty-ninth regiment and the Twenty-eighth Pennsylvania in Fort
Jackson and other forts along the Savannah river. On the 24th instant
the regiment was ordered to move at 9 A. M. The Twenty-ninth, in rear
of the Twenty-eighth Pennsylvania volunteers, marched to the city of
Savannah, passing through it, and encamping on the west side.

On the 25th, 26th, 27th, 28th and 29th, fixing company quarters, and
attending to the usual routine of camp and guard duty. Friday, the
30th, the army reviewed. The Twenty-ninth regiment moved from camp
at 8:30 A. M., and marched to Liberty street in the city of Savannah,
where it joined the brigade formed on the left, in prolongation with
the Sixty-sixth regiment of Ohio volunteers. After review it returned
to its old camp at 2 o’clock P. M. Saturday, the 31st, inspection and
muster for pay at 10 A. M.

January 1, 1865, monthly inspection at 2 o’clock P. M. 2d, 3d, 4th and
5th, nothing occurred except the usual camp duty. 6th, 7th, 8th and
9th, in camp, and up to the 18th the Twenty-ninth was doing camp duty,
and on the 18th received news of the fall of Fort Fisher. From the 19th
to the 25th engaged in camp duty and regimental drill.

  HEADQUARTERS TWENTY-NINTH OHIO    }
  VETERAN VOLUNTEER INFANTRY.       }
  SAVANNAH, GEORGIA, DEC. 28, 1864. }

 A. H. W. Creigh, first lieutenant, and acting assistant
 adjutant-general First brigade, Second division, Twentieth corps:

“LIEUTENANT:--In compliance with circular from headquarters First
brigade, Second division, Twentieth corps, dated Savannah, Georgia,
December 23, 1864, I have the honor most respectfully to make the
following report:

“I took command of the regiment in front of Savannah, Georgia, on
December 20, 1864. Nothing worthy of note transpired during the day.
At 4 o’clock A. M. of the 21st instant the Twenty-ninth in advance of
the First brigade, took up a line of march to the city of Savannah,
and from there to Fort Jackson, when I reported to Colonel Flinn,
Twenty-eighth Pennsylvania volunteers, for duty, and performed garrison
duty until December 24th, when the regiment was ordered to march at
9:30 A. M. The Twenty-ninth in rear of Twenty-eighth Pennsylvania
volunteers, marched to the city, and through it to the west side, where
we are now encamped.

  “I am very respectfully, your obedient servant,
  JONAS SCHOONOVER,
  Captain commanding Twenty-ninth Ohio Veteran Volunteer
  Infantry.”

  “HEADQUARTERS FIRST BRIGADE,           }
  SECOND DIVISION, TWENTIETH ARMY CORPS. }
  SAVANNAH, GEORGIA, DECEMBER 25, 1864.  }

  “Captain W. T. Forbes, assistant adjutant general:

 “In compliance with circular order No. 144, I have the honor to submit
 the following report of the operations of this brigade, from the
 capture of Atlanta, September 2, 1864, to the occupation of Savannah,
 Georgia, December 21, 1864, etc., etc.... December 2d, the march was
 resumed at daybreak and was uninterrupted until Buckhead creek was
 reached. The bridge over this place was partially destroyed, and a few
 of the enemy’s cavalry were on the opposite side of the swamp. Major
 Wright, commanding the Twenty-ninth Ohio volunteers, was ordered to
 cross the creek with his regiment and drive and keep away this force,
 which was accomplished without loss. The command camped for the night
 near Buckhead church.... December 12th to December 20th inclusive,
 a substantial line of works was thrown up for the protection of the
 command from the artillery of the enemy, and in addition to this two
 forts, with thirteen embrasures in the aggregate, were constructed by
 the command. The working parties on Fort No. 2 were under the command
 of Captain Kreicler, One Hundred and Forty-seventh Pennsylvania
 volunteers, and those on Fort No. 3 under command of Captain E. B.
 Woodbury, Twenty-ninth Ohio volunteers. Both these officers and the
 men under their command are deserving of praise for the energy and
 perseverance manifested in the prosecution of the duty assigned them.

 “December 21st, the enemy having evacuated their position the
 night previous, their works were occupied at an early hour by the
 skirmishers of the division, and by sunrise the city of Savannah was
 entered and occupied, this brigade being in line in the advance into
 the city. Soon after reaching the city, the Twenty-eighth Pennsylvania
 and Twenty-ninth Ohio volunteers, under command of Colonel John Flynn,
 were, by order of the commanding-general of division, through Captain
 Veale, aide-de-camp, dispatched to occupy Fort Jackson and the smaller
 forts and batteries near it. The possession of the forts and other
 works was gained with but slight resistance.

 “Inventory of ordnance and ordnance stores captured by the
 Twenty-ninth Ohio volunteers and the Twenty-eighth Pennsylvania
 in Fort Jackson and other forts on the Savannah river:
 Forty-four thirty-two-pounders, two ten-inch Columbiads, twenty
 eight-inch Columbiads, two rifled thirty-two-pounders, twelve
 twenty-four-pounder howitzers, one eight-inch mortar, three
 three-inch rifled field-pieces, etc., etc. Of the ninety-one guns
 captured, fourteen only were found to have been spiked and shotted.
 The gun-carriages were broken and temporarily disabled, and all the
 implements were broken and destroyed.

 “To the regimental commanders I tender my thanks for the strict
 obedience to orders, and the enforcement of the regulation prescribed
 in regard to the conduct of the march, and especially are they due to
 Major M. T. Wright, Twenty-ninth Ohio volunteers, who was seriously
 wounded while supervising the working parties on the forts, for the
 promptitude exhibited by him in the execution of all orders, and his
 strict attention to the duties incumbent on him throughout the entire
 campaign.

  “Respectfully submitted,
  “ARIO PARDEE,
  Commanding Brigade.”


EXTRACT--OFFICIAL REPORT OF GENERAL GEARY.

 “December 29th, a conference of the division and brigade commanders
 with the general commanding the corps, was held at 10 A. M. to-day,
 with the view to the adoption of a plan for storming the enemy’s
 works, as soon as the heavy guns should be in readiness to open fire.
 Fort No. 1 was finished this evening. The details from the First and
 Third brigades continued work on the other forts during the night,
 under a heavy artillery fire from the enemy. Several casualties
 occurred, among them Major Wright, a most valuable officer, commanding
 the Twenty-ninth Ohio volunteers, who was severely wounded by a shell.
 Sloan’s battery of three-inch rifled guns had already taken position
 in a work thrown up to the right of Fort 3, and in the open field.

 “December 20th. The usual artillery firing and sharp shooting to-day.
 By this evening we had constructed and in readiness for use in the
 contemplated assault, two hundred large straw fascines, to fill up
 ditches in front of the enemy’s works; also a large number of fascines
 made of bamboo-cane. The latter were to be used for bridging the canal
 by laying them across baulks, which were furnished from the pontoon
 train for that purpose. The work on Forts 2 and 3 was well advanced
 to-day, and would probably be completed to-night. Three siege-guns
 (thirty-pounder Parrotts) were brought down this evening and mounted
 in Fort No. 2. I ascertained this morning that the enemy had completed
 a pontoon bridge from Savannah across to the South Carolina shore, and
 notified the general commanding corps of the discovery. This bridge
 was about two and a half miles from my left. The usual artillery
 firing was kept up by the enemy during the day and night. During the
 night I heard the movement of troops and wagons across the pontoon
 bridge before mentioned, and sent a report of the fact to the general
 commanding corps. Leaving one of my staff to watch the sounds in that
 direction, I notified my officer of the day and brigade commanders
 to keep a vigilant watch upon the enemy, as they were probably
 evacuating. The details on Forts 2 and 3 continued working through the
 night, the enemy shelling them heavily.

 “December 21st. After 3 o’clock this morning the firing ceased, and my
 pickets advancing to the enemy’s line, found them hastily retreating.
 Having possession of their line of works with all their cannon in
 front of my own and the other division of the corps, I immediately
 sent a staff officer to notify the general commanding, and at the
 same time pushed forward rapidly in the direction of Savannah, hoping
 to overtake and capture a part of the enemy’s force. My skirmishers
 deployed and swept over all the ground between the evacuated works
 and the Ogeechee canal, from the river to the Augusta road, while my
 main body of troops marched rapidly by the flank through McAlpin’s
 plantation to the Augusta road, and on into the city. Just outside
 of the city limits near the junction of the Louisville and Augusta
 roads, I met the mayor of Savannah and a delegation from the board of
 alderman, bearing a flag of truce. From them I received in the name
 of my commanding general the surrender of the city. This was at 4:30
 A. M., and I sent immediately another staff officer to announce the
 surrender to the general commanding the corps. He had considerable
 difficulty in passing the line of another division of this corps on
 the Augusta road, but finally convinced them that he belonged to
 the Twentieth corps and not to the enemy. In the meantime my entire
 division entered the city of Savannah at early dawn, and before the
 sun first gilded the morning clouds, our National colors, side by side
 with those of my own division, were unfurled from the dome of the
 exchange, and over the United States custom house. The brigade which
 led on entering the city, was at once ordered to patrol it, reduce it
 to order and quiet, and prevent any pillaging or lawlessness on the
 part either of soldiers or citizens. My orders on the subject were
 very strict, and within a few hours this city, in which I had found
 a lawless mob of low whites and negroes pillaging and setting fire
 to property, was reduced to order. Many millions of dollars worth of
 cotton, ordnance and commissary stores, etc., which would have been
 otherwise destroyed, were saved to the United States Government, and
 the citizens once more enjoyed security under the protection of that
 flag which again waved over them, exactly four years since the passage
 by the State of South Carolina of the Secession Act.

 “Two regiments from Pardee’s brigade, the Twenty-eighth Pennsylvania
 and Twenty-ninth Ohio veteran volunteers, were sent down to Fort
 Jackson, and early in the morning had possession of it and all the
 intermediate and surrounding works. The iron-plated ram, Savannah,
 which lay in the river below the city, threw shells at these two
 regiments as they flung the stars and stripes to the breeze from the
 walls of Fort Jackson. All the other gun-boats of the enemy had been
 fired by them and burned to the water’s edge.

 “On the arrival of the major-general commanding the left wing, I was,
 by his order, placed in command of the city. Until nearly 10 A. M.
 continued firing was heard in the direction of Beaulieu, and supposing
 that a portion of the enemy might still be south of us, I kept one
 brigade under arms during the forenoon. Three rebel flags were
 captured by my command, which will be duly forwarded.

  “I am, Colonel, very-respectfully
  Your obedient servant,
  JOHN W. GEARY,
  Brigadier-general commanding Second division Twentieth
  corps.”

which the following matter, furnished by comrade G. W. Holloway, will
sufficiently explain.

The new flag for the Twenty-ninth regiment, contributed by the citizens
of Summit and Ashtabula counties, was accompanied by the following
letter from Colonels Buckley and Fitch. The receipt of the new flag is
gracefully acknowledged by the letter of Mr. G. W. Holloway, appended
thereto, which letter was accompanied by the old flag, which had been
borne by this gallant regiment in so many bloody battles.

  AKRON, May, 1865.

 COL. JONAS SCHOONOVER. DEAR SIR:--We have the honor and pleasure of
 forwarding to the gallant old Twenty-ninth another national flag,
 the gift of its old friends in Ashtabula and Summit counties. This
 is the third national flag given the regiment from the same source.
 It is certainly a strong proof that its friends still believe it to
 be one of the bravest of the brave of the many noble regiments Ohio
 has given to fight this great battle. If the regiment had no other
 proof than its old and tattered flags, that alone would show that it
 had been in the thickest of the fight, ever ready to breast the fury
 of the battle storm; but its history tells us that it has borne an
 honorable part in nearly a score of the hardest fought battles of the
 war. Citizen soldiers, take this flag and bear it aloft wherever duty
 calls, and your friends will take your past record as a guarantee that
 it will never be dishonored by the Twenty-ninth Ohio Veteran Volunteer
 Infantry. Colonel, please remember us to the dear old Twenty-ninth,
 and accept for yourself our best wishes.

  LEWIS P. BUCKLEY,
  WILLIAM T. FITCH,
  Old Cols. of the Twenty-ninth Ohio.

  HEADQUARTERS TWENTY-NINTH OHIO,      }
  BLADENSBURG, MARYLAND, June 5, 1865. }

  Colonels Buckley and Fitch, and S. A. Lane, Esq.:

 GENTLEMEN:--In the name of the officers and men of the Twenty-ninth
 Ohio veteran volunteer infantry, I herewith acknowledge the receipt
 of the beautiful flag presented the regiment, and in return I present
 to you the old one, which it has been our proud honor to carry
 victoriously over many hard-fought battlefields. That dear “old flag”
 which has been our companion through years of fearful war and carnage,
 and which symbolizes our glorious nationality, tells its own story.
 We return it to you, but not so beautiful in form and color as when
 presented to us eighteen months ago. But whilst its external beauty
 has been defaced, yet the great life-giving principles of which it is
 the exponent, are all the more deeply enshrined in the hearts of its
 defenders, and Liberty receives through this standard another bright
 and shining star to her beautiful constellation. Take it, then, and
 place it among the archives of the nation, that it may be preserved as
 a sacred memorial, and handed down to latest posterity as a glorious
 legacy and standard that was borne, as by angel hands, in opposition
 to oppression and rebellion. Be assured that it is with a renewed
 national pride that we look upon this beautiful flag presented to
 the Twenty-ninth Ohio, by the patriotic and loyal citizens of Summit
 and Ashtabula counties. The past history of almost four years in
 war, speaks for our conduct as soldiers and patriots for the future.
 We promise never to desert this flag, nor will we permit traitors
 or rebels to wrest it from our hands. We will always be willing and
 ready to unfurl it in defense of the principles of our glorious, free
 Republic. Truly our country’s faith has learned a new interpretation
 of her standard. The white typifies the purity of purpose which
 belongs to her true ruler; the red points to the crimson tide in which
 life flows forth a willing offering; the blue reminds her of her home
 in heaven, to which all the good are gathered; the stars in her banner
 tell of light in darkness, and she shall learn to range them in a new
 and beautiful order, as the constellation of the cross. It is that
 flag which has solved most conclusively the long disputed problem of
 a free republican form of government. It was that flag which was so
 bravely and triumphantly carried through the ordeal of war by our
 Revolutionary sires, and encircled them with a halo of glory that
 shall be handed down untarnished to millions of unborn freemen. It
 was that flag which, under God, enabled our forefathers to gain our
 glorious independence, and here, in this beautiful land of lakes and
 rivers, rear a temple of liberty which stands first among the nations
 of the earth, the envy and admiration of all. It is the flag which we
 have learned to love and to defend, and which we cherish in our hearts
 as the guardian angel of our country.

 May that same God who has given so many brave hearts to defend it,
 continue to preserve it, and may it give light and liberty to millions
 who are yet groaning under tyranny and oppression. But we would not
 pass by unnoticed the many noble brave men who offered themselves a
 willing sacrifice upon our country’s altar in defense of that national
 banner. The voices of our fallen comrades are borne to us in solemn
 silence by every breeze that fans our brow. The South is billowed with
 the graves where sleep the patriot martyrs of constitutional liberty,
 until the resurrection morn. We hold them dear to our hearts, for
 may it never be forgotten that their deeds of valor facilitated the
 consummation of the glorious results which have just been achieved.
 Though they be dead, they yet speak, and will continue to speak to
 the end of all time, and dear to each patriot heart will ever be the
 memory of those who died in defense of the Union.

      “There are many
  Patriots have toiled in their country’s cause,
  Bled nobly, and their deeds, as they deserve,
  Receive proud recompense. We give in charge
  Their names to the sweet lyre. The historic muse
  Proud of her charge, marches with it down
  To latest time: and sculpture, in her turn,
  Gives bond, in stone and ever-during brass,
  To guard and immortalize her trust.”

At Bladensburg we went into camp, and remained until June 10. Marched
to Washington at 8 P. M., and embarked on the cars of the Baltimore &
Ohio railroad and steamed away homeward, bound to Parkersburg by way
of Grafton, West Virginia, thence by boat to Louisville, Kentucky;
moved five miles into the country, where we remained until the 13th
day of July, when we were mustered out. Repairing to Camp Taylor, near
Cleveland, Ohio, we were paid off and formally discharged from the
service on the 22d and 23d days of July, 1865.

We have now followed the regiment through nearly four years of the
most arduous service which ever fell to the lot of any organization
of this character, marching and fighting through most of the States
in rebellion, its pathway marked by the graves of our comrades who
fell. In the interim, hundreds of the brave 1540 who were upon its
rolls, pass under the charge of the worse than fiends of hell, who
presided at Libby, Belle Isle, Andersonville, and other courts of
death, by courtesy called rebel prisons, where, after being robbed
of all they possessed, and even stripped of necessary clothing, they
were subjected to a systematic course of starvation (and that, too,
under the immediate supervision of that foul blot upon humanity, Jeff
Davis) until their brave spirits went out to the God who gave them.
In the army of the East, with the army of the West, with Sherman in
the glorious march to the sea, and the brilliant campaign of the
Carolinas--where there was danger and death--shone the “white star” of
the Twenty-ninth. The skirmish line and the advance became so nearly
the normal condition of the regiment that assignment to positions less
dangerous elicited exclamations of surprise from the “boys.”

At length the last ditch, so frequently referred to by the braggart
rebels, was reached--chivalrous Jeff Davis in hoc and crinoline begged
that mercy be shown to “woman and children.” The bubble secessia burst,
and the command, now reduced to a mere handful, turn sadly northward,
its columns “gaping from the havoc of shot and shell, and the disease
of the camp, and prison pen, its colors ragged and torn, but proud
and defiant as ever--one grand ovation to the living, a sad wailing
requiem for the dead,” and “good byes” are said in the beautiful
Forest city, as each departed for their homes to assume the peaceful
avocations of four years before.

Gradually they have drifted away--some to a quiet nook in the country
church yard, and others to the east, west, and south, until now they
may be found in nearly every State and Territory in this vast Union.
Annually they come together in re-union at some convenient point in
Puritan Western Reserve, and

  “Fight their battles o’er again.”

Each year a committee is appointed whose duty it is to draft
resolutions of condolence to the memory of the comrades whose “final
statements” have been called for since the last meeting, and this
committee _always have something to do_. Each yearly roll call is
shorter than its predecessor, and it does not require a long look into
the future to find only the roll--no one to call it, and none to answer
to their names if called.

  Absent “comrades, gone before us
  In the ‘great review’ to pass--
  Never more to earthly chieftain
  Dipping colors as ye pass--
  Heaven accord ye gentle judgment
  As before the throne ye pass.”

While almost within gun shot of the site of the canvass covered field
of 1861, busily engaged in well nigh vain endeavors to retain his grip
upon the “ragged edge” of a somewhat precarious existence, and but
a few laps in advance of the grim gentleman with the hour glass and
scythe, abides

  THE DRUMMER BOY(?) OF COMPANY B.




GENERAL REVIEW.


The following review of the battles, sieges, marches, and campaigns in
which the Twenty-ninth regiment was engaged, is from the pen of Colonel
Jonas Schoonover. It gives in brief the important work of the regiment
during its nearly four years’ service, and should the “gentle reader”
find the descriptive portion of the history too voluminous, she has but
to turn to this review to find consolation.

Beginning with the service in the winter of 1861-2, along the waters
of the Potomac and its tributaries, and in the mountain regions of
Hampshire county, the Romney expedition in West Virginia, the advance
to Winchester via Little mountain and Martinsburg, thence into the
Shenandoah valley. The Strasburg march, which ended in the battle of
Winchester, where the Federal army, under General Shields, and the
rebels, commanded by General T. J. Jackson, at Kernstown, engaged in a
sanguinary battle on March 23d, 1862, in which the Union army gained a
victory. The Twenty-ninth Ohio done its full share, suffering slight
loss in killed and wounded. The march up the valley to Madisonburg;
the long march to Fredericksburg, leaving the Shenandoah valley at
New Market on the 12th day of May, 1862, and reaching Fredericksburg
May 22, 1862, a day or two later returning to Luray via Warrenton
and Front Royal, up the Luray valley to Port Republic, where, on the
9th day of June, it engaged in battle with heavy loss in killed and
wounded. One hundred and ten were made prisoners. The Twenty-ninth
was engaged at short range in the open field against three times its
number over four hours. During the time the struggle was desperate on
both sides. The battle of Cedar mountain, seven miles from Culpepper
Courthouse, on August 9th, the Union army under Banks, the rebels under
Longstreet, the Twenty-ninth was engaged in the open field without
cover, and sustained considerable loss. Then followed the retrograde
move to Culpepper; the campaign of General Pope, including the second
battle of Bull Run; and the march to Frederick City; the winter and
spring campaign of 1862 and 1863, under Major-general Joseph Hooker,
at Dumfries, was memorable for its intense suffering; then came the
march to Chancellorsville, and the battle there, which began May 1st,
and ended on the 3d, in which the Twenty-ninth suffered heavy loss and
was the last to leave the field. May 5th we crossed the Rappahannock on
our way to Gettysburg via Aqua creek, Dumfries, Fairfax Court House,
Leesburg, Edward’s Ferry, Harper’s Ferry, Frederick, and Littletown,
where we fought one of the most determined battles of the war,
commencing on the 1st and ending on the 4th day of July, 1863.

We returned to Virginia; moved to New York to quell riots; returned
again; advanced to the Rapidan; reported to the Department of the
Cumberland, via the Baltimore & Ohio railroad, crossing the Ohio
river at Bellaire. On September 30th, we passed through Columbus,
Ohio; Indianapolis, Indiana, and Louisville, Kentucky, and halted at
Murfreesboro, Tennessee. In October we passed down to Stevenson and
Bridgeport, Alabama, and up the Tennessee river to Wauhatchie valley.

On November 24th and 25th, we were engaged in the battle of Lookout
mountain; Missionary Ridge on November 24th and 25th, and Taylor’s
Ridge and Ringgold, Georgia, on November 26th and 27th, 1863.

In December of the same year we re-enlisted, and during the winter
we prepared for a vigorous and active campaign in the early spring
of 1864. On May 3d, we left Bridgeport, Alabama, on the Georgia
campaign, passing around Lookout Mountain, Rossville, and Crawfish
springs. On May 8th, the Twenty-ninth regiment took an active part
in the battle of Dug Gap, Georgia, where it distinguished itself for
bravery unparalleled in modern history; every fourth man was killed or
wounded. We moved on to Resaca, and in the fight of the 14th our loss
was light. We moved on to Calhoun, Adairsville, Kingston, and Cassville
on May 21st. In the battle of Pumpkin Vine Creek (or Dallas) from May
25th to the 28th, we met with some loss. In the battle of Pine Knob on
June 15th, the Twenty-ninth suffered severe loss. Many of its brave
heroes, whose valor will ever be held in memory by every survivor
of the Twenty-ninth regiment, were killed. The battles of Lost and
Kenesaw Mountain were on June 20th and 27th, and we advanced to the
Chattahoochie river, via Marietta, Georgia, and then to the battle of
Peach Tree Creek.

The Georgia campaign, from May 8th until the evacuation of Atlanta on
September 2, 1864, a period of four months, was one continuous battle.
The marching through Georgia was a glorious achievement, and will ever
be recorded as one of the most brilliant feats in this or any other
war. In Sherman’s grand march to the sea and the siege and capture of
Savannah, Georgia, the Twenty-ninth did its full share. It was engaged
from December 10th to the 21st, when it entered the city of Savannah.
On January 27, 1865, we moved on the campaign through the Carolinas,
and were engaged in the following battles, and skirmishes of this
campaign; Averysboro, North Carolina, on March 16th; Bentonville,
North Carolina, on March 19, 1865, and marching to Goldsboro on March
24th. After Johnston’s army at Raleigh, North Carolina, and the final
march through Virginia to Washington in May, 1865, we took part in the
grand review, thence to Louisville, Kentucky, on to Camp Taylor at
Cleveland, Ohio, and home. The regiment was in the service nearly four
years, and it is but justice to state that during its entire term it
was _never driven from its position by direct assault_.

TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES

This ebook was transcribed by a native of the state of Ohio.

This book transcription is dedicated to Thaddeus “Ted” Slade, also a
native Ohioan and the biggest Civil War history buff I know.

Some punctuation has been standardized. Some alternate spellings
may have been retained. Some obvious misspellings and typographical
errors/omissions have been corrected. Any other changes are noted below.

Some inconsistencies in human or place names were corrected by
correlating with names elsewhere in the text.

The errata from the original book was applied to this text.

p. 60: Inserted a probable missing beginning of paragraph. (“[It] is
perhaps unnecessary”)

p. 64: Corrected year in chapter description from 1862 to 1863. The
Battle of Chancellorsville took place in 1863, and the end of the prior
chapter also indicates we are in mid-1863 at this point in the journal.

p. 120: Corrected date “August 2st” to August 1st (“August 1st to 3d,
hot firing all the time.”). The phrasing “to” vs. “and” makes a date
range of larger than two days likely, and it’s more reasonable to
believe the printer misplaced 2 for 1, than misplaced “st” for “nd”.

p. 143: Corrected time from 6:30 to 9:30 (“at 9:30 fell in and marched
six miles as rear guard to the Twentieth army corps”). It’s not logical
that they would move from 8:00am back to 6:30am in the journal. The
printer presumably set 6 in place of 9, or inverted the 9.

p. 232: Corrected the discharge date for John H. Finneman (confirmed
using records found on civilwarindex.com on January 23, 2021). As
printed, the date was June 18, 1865.

p. 241: Corrected Lysander T. King’s company from “T” to “F” per the
company F listing on p. 206.
