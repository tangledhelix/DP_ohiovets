### Project manager notes ###

In the list of casualties starting on 232 most of the captured and a few others have a `*` after their name. I do not know what it means, but it is not a footnote, so it should be left as `*`. No need for square brackets.

### Forum notes ###

Some times appear as `12 M`. This is an old fashioned notation meaning Meridian (not AM, not PM... exactly M) and it means midday or noon.

A note from the PM on the rosters toward the end of the book (162 and later). Rather than lists, they suggested leaving as paragraphs.
