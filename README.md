### Project manager notes ###

In the list of casualties starting on 232 most of the captured and a few others have a `*` after their name. I do not know what it means, but it is not a footnote, so it should be left as `*`. No need for square brackets.

### Forum notes ###

Some times appear as `12 M`. This is an old fashioned notation meaning Meridian (not AM, not PM... exactly M) and it means midday or noon.

A note from the PM on the rosters toward the end of the book (162 and later). Rather than lists, they suggested leaving as paragraphs.

### General notes ###

### Illustrations ###

- [x] cover (need to fabricate one)

### Things to revisit ###

- [ ] Add the disclaimer bit about having fabricated a custom cover

### Proofer's notes ###

### Joined hyphenated words ###

### Spellcheck ###

### Transcriber's notes ###

Some inconsistencies in spelling, hyphenation, and punctuation have been
retained.

A number of typos in human or placee names were found and corrected, some by correlating with names elsewhere in the text.

p. 60: Inserted a probable missing beginning of paragraph: [It] is perhaps...

p. 64: Corrected year in chapter description from 1862 to 1863. Chancellorsville was 1863, and the end of the prior chapter also indicates we are in mid-1863 at this point in the journal.

p. 120: Corrected date "August 2st" to August 1st ("August 1st to 3d, hot firing all the time."). Phrasing "to" vs. "and" makes a date range of larger than 2 days likely, and it's more reasonable to believe the printer misplaced 2 for 1, than misplaced "st" for "nd".

p. 143: Corrected time from 6:30 to 9:30 ("at 9:30 fell in and marched six miles as rear guard to the Twentieth army corps"). Not logical that they move from 8:00am back to 6:30am, printer presumably set 6 in place of 9, or inverted the 9.

p. 232: Corrected discharge date for John H. Finneman (confirmed using records found on civilwarindex.com). As-printed, date was June 18, 1865.

p. 241: Corrected Lysander T. King's company from "T" to "F" per company F listing on p. 206.
