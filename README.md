### Project manager notes ###

In the list of casualties starting on 232 most of the captured and a few others have a `*` after their name. I do not know what it means, but it is not a footnote, so it should be left as `*`. No need for square brackets.

### Forum notes ###

Some times appear as `12 M`. This is an old fashioned notation meaning Meridian (not AM, not PM... exactly M) and it means midday or noon.

A note from the PM on the rosters toward the end of the book (162 and later). Rather than lists, they suggested leaving as paragraphs.

### General notes ###

### Illustrations ###

### Proofer's notes ###

### Joined hyphenated words ###

### Spellcheck ###

### Transcriber's notes ###

Some inconsistencies in spelling, hyphenation, and punctuation have been
retained.

A number of typos in human or placee names were found and corrected by correlating with names elsewhere in the book.

p. 60 - Inserted a probable missing beginning of paragraph: [It] is perhaps...

p. 241 - corrected Lysander T. King's company designation from "T" to "F" per company F listing on p. 206.
